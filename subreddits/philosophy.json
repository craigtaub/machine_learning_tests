If you&amp;#39;re more of an instagram kind of person, I&amp;#39;m &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jonathanichikawa/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (but with not much philosophy content). (If you just want the animal photos, they&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I defended my PhD dissertation (&amp;quot;Imagination and Epistemology&amp;quot;) in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I&amp;#39;m married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/\"&gt;little while back&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Research Highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2013 book, &lt;a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rules of Thought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that &lt;em&gt;no square is a triangle&lt;/em&gt;. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what &lt;em&gt;makes it rational to believe&lt;/em&gt; that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what &lt;em&gt;makes that content the content that it&lt;/em&gt; is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I published my second book, &lt;a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contextualising Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the &lt;em&gt;Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Research Focus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don&amp;#39;t\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;. (Rhetoric about &amp;quot;not jumping to conclusions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;innocent until proven guilty&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;he said\u2013she said&amp;quot; tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I&amp;#39;m currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly more generally, I&amp;#39;m thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to believe unless certain conditions are met. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t believe if you have insufficient evidence!&amp;quot;) I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!&amp;quot;) There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it&amp;#39;s one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It&amp;#39;s hard to justify activism if you don&amp;#39;t take yourself to know what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional &amp;quot;philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions&amp;quot;\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my logic course, last year I prepared a new version of &lt;a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;forall x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a fairly thorough treatment of soundness and completeness. I&amp;#39;ll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources. Given the financial constraints many students face, I think it&amp;#39;s morally important for professors to avoid expensive required textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Bits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond philosophy, I&amp;#39;m an enthusiastic amateur opera singer, photographer, and long-distance runner. I have a &lt;a href=\"http://instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla\"&gt;cat and a dog who are the best&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;#39;out&amp;#39; in a polyamorous marriage since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been pretty involved in some of the public discourse about the norms of academia and professional philosophy. I played a role a few years back in some faculty expressions of concern about UBC&amp;#39;s treatment of sexual assault allegations, and of UBC governance concerns generally.

              "selftext": "Most of my work is centred around epistemology, with a particular emphasis on knowledge, contextualism, the a priori, and connections between epistemology and practical, social, and political issues.\n\nLet me start with one FAQ, regarding [my name](http://jichikawa.net/some-notes-on-what-my-name-is). The full name I use for professional and personal purposes is \u201cJonathan Jenkins Ichikawa\u201d. \u201cJenkins\u201d is my middle name, and it is optional in all contexts. I added it when I married Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins in 2011. Redditors in this AMA should feel free to address me as \u201cJonathan\u201d, \u201cDr. Ichikawa\u201d, or \u201cProfessor Ichikawa\u201d, according to their preferred level of formality.\n\n**Ask me anything!**\n\nI'm active on twitter [@jichikawa](https://twitter.com/jichikawa). [Here](http://jichikawa.net/) is my personal website. If you're more of an instagram kind of person, I'm [here](https://www.instagram.com/jonathanichikawa/) (but with not much philosophy content). (If you just want the animal photos, they're [here](https://www.instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla/).)\n\n\n**Bio:**\n\nI was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.\n\nI defended my PhD dissertation (\"Imagination and Epistemology\") in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I'm married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a [little while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/).)\n\n**Past Research Highlights:**\n\nMy 2013 book, [*The Rules of Thought*](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do)\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that *no square is a triangle*. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what *makes it rational to believe* that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what *makes that content the content that it* is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.\n\nLast year I published my second book, [*Contextualising Knowledge*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;). Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the *Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism*.\n\n**Current Research Focus:**\n\nContextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.\n\nSomething similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don't\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further *proof*. (Rhetoric about \"not jumping to conclusions\", \"innocent until proven guilty\", and \"he said\u2013she said\" tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I'm currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.\n\nSlightly more generally, I'm thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says *not* to believe unless certain conditions are met. (\"Don't believe if you have insufficient evidence!\") I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (\"Don't suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!\") There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it's one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It's hard to justify activism if you don't take yourself to know what's going on.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nIn addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional \"philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions\"\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.\n\nFor my logic course, last year I prepared a new version of [*forall x*](https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU), an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a fairly thorough treatment of soundness and completeness. I'll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources. Given the financial constraints many students face, I think it's morally important for professors to avoid expensive required textbooks.\n\n**Other Bits:**\n\nBeyond philosophy, I'm an enthusiastic amateur opera singer, photographer, and long-distance runner. I have a [cat and a dog who are the best](http://instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla). I've been 'out' in a polyamorous marriage since 2011.\n\nI've been pretty involved in some of the public discourse about the norms of academia and professional philosophy. I played a role a few years back in some faculty expressions of concern about UBC's treatment of sexual assault allegations, and of UBC governance concerns generally. I've also been outspoken about things like journal editorial policies and the *Philosophical Gourmet Report*, as well as some famous examples of sexual harassment complaints in philosophy. I think it's fair to say I'm a slightly polarising figure within academic philosophy. Usually the trolls treat me only moderately terribly. Some get it far worse than I do.\n\n**Some of My Work:**\n\n* [*The Rules of Thought*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-rules-of-thought-9780198748182?lang=en&amp;cc=us) \u2014 my 2014 book, co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis.

This made me realise important difference between a normal program and a neural network. It this short essay, i will argue why a neural network is an automated opinion, which is something, in my opinion, essential to solving all the other problem regarding AI\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The difference&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past computer programs were in either a way for us to interact with computers, or an atomisation of a task. These programs are given a set of rules to act on by the programmer. Now there is a new way to automate the tasks: the neural network. \nIt, however, creates its own rules. It looks for itself what the most efficient way is. It has a view for it self on how to solve an issue. A neural network projects its own view on every problem, to find the most efficient way.\nOnly the inputs and outputs of the neural network can be looked at, and if given a way to measure if the output is good or bad, the efficiency can be measured, but it is not possible at this moment to understand why it comes to a certain conclusion. Its view is thus closed of and private.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A neural network has a goal. I make decisions because I want to reach a goal, if I&amp;#39;d not make decisions according to my goal, my decision would be random, like at the start of the neural network. You could say that the neural networks goal is to be right, to tell the truth.\nWhen I tell a trained a neural network on dog and cats, gets a picture of a cat, it makes a choice, this choice is in accordance with its goal. \nI do not say a neural network wants to reach this goal. I do not say it is making a conscious choice.\nBut it has two options and the answer is only one, so a choice has been made, and this choice is in accordance with its goal of telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;A view&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it makes a choice, in accordance with its goals. Every choice that is not random presupposes a way to judge whatever is at hand, since the choices of the AI are not random, but in accordance with a goal. The AI has learned on what parts of the picture to pay attention to, it is its way to judge the picture. This judgement is not based on what the programer says, like with normal programs, but on what the program shaped itself with outside input. A view is something we shape ourselves, with outside input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;opinion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The definition of opinion according to the dictionary (&lt;a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion\"&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion&lt;/a&gt;) is a  personal  view,  attitude,  or  appraisal.

The biggest difference I think there is, is that at this moment machines cannot argue their opinions.

It is an upper division general education course. I started doing research about a week before but realized on Sunday that I did not actually completely understand the dialectic process. I\u2019m still not sure if I have correctly. I started writing Sunday at 12pm, wrote until 6am, slept, continued at 10am and submitted it at 4pm on Monday. If I had done this a week ago, I could have asked my professor for feedback but I am taking the class credit/not credit so I just needed to pass. Also, I\u2019m a terrible procrastinator. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcomed!!! :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I just realized I was braindead upon finishing and didn\u2019t proofread. Sorry for the mess. I will fix it tomorrow. \n~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 \u2013 1831) was a predominant figure in 19th century German philosophy. He contributed widely to German Idealism, a philosophical movement spurred as a reaction to Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Generally, idealism is the theory that fundamental reality is made up of one\u2019s thoughts or ideas. It holds that one cannot be certain that any matter of the outside world exists and that the only thing truly knowable is consciousness. Hegel achieved significant renown in his day, given his first book, Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes, was his most thoroughly discussed philosophical work. Since the German word \u2018geist\u2019 is understood through multiple definitions, the title may translate to either The Phenomenology of Spirit or The Phenomenology of Mind. In this book, Hegel applied his three-stage dialectical method as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the life of one\u2019s spirit. According to The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \u201c\u2018Dialectics\u2019 is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between the opposing sides.\u201d In Plato\u2019s Republic, he presented a basic form of a dialectic as a back-and-forth argument between Socrates and his students. Socrates posed the question, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d and goes on to refute each student\u2019s answer; forcing each student to refine their belief by adopting Socrates\u2019 refutation and forming a more sophisticated view. A central term in Hegelian dialectics is the verb \u2018aufhebeng\u2019, which, in this context, translates to \u2018to sublate\u2019 or \u2018to cancel and to preserve at the same time\u2019. In Plato\u2019s example, each of Socrates\u2019 student\u2019s original belief is sublated with Socrates\u2019 challenge to adopt the more sophisticated view. The students cancel parts of their original belief while simultaneously preserving sophisticated pieces to combine with Socrates\u2019 challenge. This process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 may happen multiple times within a single \u2018dialectical conflict\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fundamental premise of Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to understand history as a sequence of \u2018dialectical conflicts\u2019. The purpose of the Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to achieve spiral evolution of higher thinking by using the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Each conflict begins with what is called the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. This \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment is merely potential for a reality to be actualized. The reality one is concerned with is implicit, or implied, in the moment. The German phrase Hegel used, \u2018an-sich\u2019, directly translates to \u2018in-itself\u2019, but is better understood when colloquially translated to \u2018by-itself\u2019. The reality is \u2018by-itself\u2019, or implicit, in this moment. The reality must be exteriorized, or made explicit, so one can actualize it. In Plato\u2019s The Republic, reality was the adoption of a more sophisticated view. If a student provided an answer to Socrates\u2019 question, the reality would be implicit, or \u2018by-itself\u2019, and not explicit to the student. Without additional information, a student would be unable to form a view more sophisticated than that of their own answer. Additionally, it would be impossible for Socrates to negate the student if the student never initially provided an answer. When Socrates negated their answer, he exteriorized the reality of adopting a more sophisticated view by explicit telling them the more sophisticated view in the form of an argument. The moment in which reality is exteriorized, or explicit, is called the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment. Since dialectics rely on a contradictory process, the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment must negate, or contradict, the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment in order to exteriorize reality. Once reality is explicit, the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 starts and creates an \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment by eliminating flaws from the first two moments and leaving behind ideas and elements that hold true for both. For Plato, the student forms a new, more sophisticated view by disregarding the flaws in their own view while preserving the sophisticated elements in both their own and Socrates\u2019 view. Once complete, the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment serves as the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment for a new dialectical conflict. Hegel believed that by allowing the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment to serve as the next \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment, the dialectical process would result in the spiral evolution of higher thinking because the newly actualized reality would contain potential for another \u2018new reality to be actualized\u2019. For example, once a student adopted the more sophisticated view, Socrates refuted it in the form of an argument, effectively exteriorizing the implicit reality contained in the new \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. A student would proceed to form a more sophisticated view point from an already formed \u2018more sophisticated viewpoint\u2019. Using more simplistic terms, one can understand this process as: problem \u2192 reaction \u2192 solution, where the problem contains an implicit solution and the solution provides a new problem that contains a new implicit solution. Going forward, these three moments will be referred to in accordance with Johann Fichte\u2019s commentary, which uses thesis, antithesis and synthesis in place of \u2018in-itself\u2019, \u2018for-itself\u2019 and \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019.  The most effective way to understand Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to use it to analyze the progression of history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hegel\u2019s dialectic can be used as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 100BCE, Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family that politically aligned itself with plebeian politicians (Watkins). In 84BCE, after his father\u2019s death, Julius Caesar married the daughter of revolutionary Gaius Marius, a Roman general and statesmen who held office of consul seven times. When Lucius Sulla, opponent of Marius, gained control of Rome, he ordered Caesar to divorce his wife. Caesar refused, irrevocably committing himself to the plebeian-popular side of politics in Rome. Caesar fled the anti-revolutionary forces and served in the Roman army until Sulla\u2019s death in 78BCE (Watkins). Once free from Sulla, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and served in government as a prosecution attorney. Caesar\u2019s first major case was against an associate of Sulla but the court was composed of senators who sympathized with Sulla\u2019s anti-revolutionary movement and did not charge the associate. Over the next years, Caesar asserted himself into Roman government, organized a private army to defend attacks from Mithridates VI and worked with Pompey, a former lieutenant of Sulla, to repeal constitutional reform enacted by Sulla himself (Watkins). From 69BCE to 61BCE, Julius Caesar served his term as quaestor in Farther Spain, was elected to the office of aedile and held public festivals in order to solicit support from plebeians. Most importantly, by 59BCE, Caesar had formed an unofficial alliance with his old political friend, Pompey, and another former lieutenant of Sulla, Marcus Crassus (Bishop, 7). Caesar was a popular politician who was known for favoring the common peasant. Pompey was a political and military leader renowned for his victories in Italy and West Asia. Lastly, Marcus Crassus was a property speculator, the largest landowner and richest man in Rome. Angered that the senate constantly threw out their proposed bill, the alliance aimed to overcome the senate\u2019s opposition by influencing Caesar\u2019s election into the consul (Bishop, 7). Despite the senate\u2019s efforts, Caesar is successfully elected in 59BCE and his entrance into the consul marked the beginning of the dialectical conflict. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By challenging the senators, enacting reform and expanding the Republic\u2019s borders, Caesar asserted himself into government and gave potential to actualizing the reality of establishing a new government in place of the Republic. Since this reality was still implicit, as nothing had yet exteriorized it, no one was able to create an entire, new government.  As a member of consul, the first law Caesar introduced distributed government owned land in Italy to the landless poor for the purpose of farming. This law did not receive explicit opposition from the senate, but neither did it receive explicit support (Bishop, 7). In 58BCE, Julius Caesar was designated governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul and Illyria for five years. Wanting dramatic military success, Caesar found an excuse to invade Gaul and earn what he always sought. In 53BCE, at the Battle of Carrhae, Marcus Crassus perished in war, effectively disbanding the alliance and deteriorating the relationship between Caesar and Pompey (Watkins). With Caesar still fighting in Gaul, Pompey revealed to Rome that he was truly ambivalent toward Caesar and proceeded to ally with Caesar\u2019s enemies. The Roman senators demanded Caesar turn over his army\u2019s control to the government, but Caesar chose a civil war over laying down his command. After forcing Pompey to flee and defeating the rest of his troops, Julius Caesar became the prominent figure of the Roman state, where he enforced his power as \u2018dictator in perpetuity\u2019 (Bishop, 7). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A group of senators feared for the safety of the Roman Republic so in 44BCE, they conspired against and successfully assassinated Julius Caesar at a senate meeting. Caesar\u2019s removal from government served as the antithesis, or negation, to his assertion into government. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation, this antithesis would be impossible if Caesar initially failed to assert himself over the government. Caesar\u2019s murder caused prominent figures still remaining in the Republic to fight for the right to govern it (Bishop, 8). The potential to create a new form of government had now been exteriorized by Caesar\u2019s death because the remaining figures realized that whoever came out victorious, would govern the Roman Republic and be able to form an entire new government. Finally, fifteen years later, in 29BCE, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus, returned to Rome as the unchallenged ruler of the Republic and started the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Octavianus maintained old republican political institutions by preserving the Senate, popular assemblies, and magisterial offices (Bishop, 8). On the contrary, him and his successors removed parts of the original government and built a system of imperial government that would tend to the empire\u2019s vast territories and connect them with the capital (Bishop, 8). The government Octavianus created, which would come to be known as The Roman Empire, served as the synthesis for Caesar\u2019s assertion into and removal from government by actualizing the original, implicit reality. Just like the politics in the Roman Republic and Empire, the legislation of United States presidencies can be analyzed and understood using Hegel\u2019s dialectic schema.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama was born in 1961 in the state of Hawaii, just two years after it was officially inaugurated. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School. He became a civil rights attorney while teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago and representing the 13th District for three terms (\u201cPresident Barack Obama.\u201d). Obama gained national attention from his landslide win during the November 2004 Senate election. Four years later, on November 4th, 2008, Obama defeated John McCain in the general election and became the first African American elected to serve as president. Obama was inaugurated on January 20th, 2009 and within the first few minutes, his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order that suspended last-minute executive orders and regulations signed in by outgoing President George W. Bush (\u201cObama Halts All Regulations Pending Review.\u201d). Additionally, he aimed to strengthen relations with the Middle East by immediately calling for what was to be a \u201cnew beginning\u201d between the United States and the Muslim world (\u201cObama in Egypt Reaches out to Muslim World.\u201d). To do this, Obama pursued a military strategy in the Middle East that emphasized drone strikes, special forces and diplomacy over large ground troop operations (Sanger). Just like his first few minutes in office, Obama\u2019s eight years were characterized by significant accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In November of 2009, President Obama announced the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement between the United States and 11 other countries, which would bring jobs back to American soil and boost economic trade between the United States and Asia by increasing American exports to the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for forty percent of global trade and includes some of the most robust economies (\u201cObama Administration Accomplishments\u201d). The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate 18,000 different tariffs placed on exporting goods produced domestically. Ninety-five percent of the world\u2019s customers exist outside of the United States\u2019 borders. The United States Trade Representative used a Vietnamese auto parts buyer as an example of a customer. A Vietnamese person would have to pay a twenty-seven percent tax on a part made in the United States but only a five percent tax on a part made in Thailand because of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (\u201cTPP Chapter Summary\u201d). Obama was an advocate for free trade agreements because they allow a country\u2019s exports to increase while creating additional jobs domestically.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many times, during his presidency, Barack Obama described climate change to be the greatest long-term threat facing the world (Davis). In 2013, Obama bypassed Congress by directly ordering the EPA to place limits on carbon emissions. Additionally, in 2015, Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by twenty-six to twenty-eight percent by the year 2025 (Davenport). Obama\u2019s campaign to fight climate change ended up finding more success at the international level than the national. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly every country in the world agreed to a climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. This deal, the Paris Agreement, was adopted by over 195 countries and attempted to create the, \u201cbridge between today\u2019s policies and climate neutrality before the end of the century\u201d (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). In September 2016, toward the end of Obama\u2019s second term, the United States joined China in participating in the first-ever, universal, legally binding global climate deal (Somander). Collectively, the United States and China contribute to over forty percent of global emissions so successfully entering into this deal with China was a major accomplishment for the Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of Barack Obama\u2019s most controversial actions during his presidency was when he established policy by a memorandum issued from the Department of Homeland Security. This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and receive a two-year work permit that was renewable if the applicant displayed good behavior. Those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, had come to the United States when they were younger than 16 and lived in the United States since 2007 were eligible to apply (Napolitano). This policy came to be known as the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019, or more commonly, \u2018DACA\u2019. Many republicans opposed this program and denounced it as an abuse of executive power. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted 224 to 201 in favor of defunding the program, but since the program is almost entirely funded by application fees, Congress did not have the power to do so (Werner). DACA continued to be an active program until the end of Obama\u2019s second term. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t elected into the White House because of his experience nor for his role as a party leader. Obama hadn\u2019t served as a governor of a state or as a general in the army. He didn\u2019t even inherit the presidency because of an impeachment or death. Obama was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City. After earning an economic degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Trump purchased his family\u2019s real estate business and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses (\u201cDonald J. Trump.\u201d).  He went on to start various side ventures while making sure he remained in the light of the media. Donald Trump co-authored several books and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality game show on television. Over his years as a businessman, Trump gained notoriety for his racist and sexist views, which he made obvious during his campaign (Baker). Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Like Obama, Trump didn\u2019t win because of his experience in government. Donald Trump was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. In his announcement speech, Trump drew attention to illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism (Trump). After defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once his position as the 45th President of the United States was secured, on November 21st, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy that negotiates \u201cfair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\u201d (\u201cTrump Says US to Quit TPP on First Day in Office.\u201d). As part of this plan, Trump confirmed that the United States intents to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office. Two months later, on January 23rd, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though Trump\u2019s actions were criticized by other politicians like John McCain, Senator Bernie Sanders applauded Trump for pulling out of the partnership. Sanders believes that the Unites States participates in too many free trade agreements, \u201cthat cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019, which has lowered wages for American workers.\u201d (Smith). As recently as January 9th, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced an agenda for the year that is set to replace Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule (Reuters Staff). Additionally, according to the fiscal 2019 proposal released on February 12th, 2018, the United States government plans to reduce the EPA\u2019s budget by $2.5 billion, almost twenty-three percent (Dennis). On March 8, 2018, Donald Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of twenty-five percent on steel and ten percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries (\u201cTrump Tariffs: US President Imposes Levy on Steel and Aluminium.\u201d). Lastly, on September 5th, 2017, Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 program was being repealed. Sessions claimed that the DACA eligible individuals were lawbreakers who adversely impacted the wages and employment of native-born Americans (Smith). Sessions also attributed DACA as a leading cause behind the surge in unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America. Regardless of whether the Trump administration\u2019s decisions were correct, it\u2019s legislative actions are negations of Obama\u2019s implementation of the law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implementation of Barack Obama\u2019s policies served as a thesis for this dialectical conflict. Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies will serve as an antithesis for this dialectic. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation and Caesar\u2019s murder, Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies would be impossible if Barack Obama had initially failed to even implement the policies. Currently, the reality one is concerned with is still implicit because it has not been fully exteriorized yet. For reality to be exteriorized, the thesis needs to be fully negated by the antithesis. For example, currently, the Trump administration is having legal issues with the rescission of DACA as it is being challenged in court by fifteen different states. Once the Trump administration is able to completely repeal the actions of the Obama administration, the antithesis will have formed, and reality will become explicit and able to be actualized. If President Trump is able to fully repeal Obama\u2019s policies, the general public should be able to realize that electing a president from the far Right directly after a president from the far Left will make no progress. The general public should understand, in order to make progress, they must elect a president that is able to serve as the synthesis for the dialectic. The general public must elect a president that is moderate, not democratic or republican. The reality one is concerned with here is of a presidency that is a synthesis of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Donald Trump is successful in completely removing Barack Obama\u2019s policies, according to Hegel\u2019s dialectical method, what should result with the next presidency is a synthesis that removes the flaws from Obama\u2019s policies while preserving the superior ideas. The process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 would sublate Obama\u2019s superior ideas with the policies of Trump in order to form what should be a more sophisticated president. If Trump\u2019s modifications to the Environmental Protection Agency results in an overall worsening of the United States\u2019 environmental quality, then the original restrictions placed by Obama would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. Contrarily, if Trump\u2019s repealing of DACA resulted in a lowering of unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America, then Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. This careful analysis would be done for each legislative action taken by either president. Additionally, according to Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution of higher thinking, the next president would serve as the thesis for another dialectical conflict. Through Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution, one is able to eliminate less critical thinking, but must depend on an antithesis to exteriorize reality and actualize higher thinking. One is unable to conclude whether the action taken by the thesis is best serving the country until an antithesis is able to negate that action and exteriorize the implicit reality. The next presidency will be a synthesis of the past two only if President Trump is able to fully negate President Obama\u2019s policies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works Cited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baker, Peter. \u201cA President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation&amp;#39;s Racial Fires.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 12 Jan. 2018, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bishop, Paul A. \u201cRome: Transition from Republic to Empire.\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf\"&gt;www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davenport, Coral. \u201cObama&amp;#39;s Strategy on Climate Change, Part of Global Deal, Is Revealed.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Mar. 2015, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis, Julie Hirschfeld, et al. \u201cObama on Climate Change: The Trends Are &amp;#39;Terrifying&amp;#39;.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 8 Sept. 2016, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dennis, Brady. \u201cTrump Budget Seeks 23 Percent Cut at EPA, Eliminating Dozens of Programs.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 12 Feb. 2018, &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/\"&gt;www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDonald J.

I will fix it tomorrow. \n~~\n\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 \u2013 1831) was a predominant figure in 19th century German philosophy. He contributed widely to German Idealism, a philosophical movement spurred as a reaction to Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Generally, idealism is the theory that fundamental reality is made up of one\u2019s thoughts or ideas. It holds that one cannot be certain that any matter of the outside world exists and that the only thing truly knowable is consciousness. Hegel achieved significant renown in his day, given his first book, Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes, was his most thoroughly discussed philosophical work. Since the German word \u2018geist\u2019 is understood through multiple definitions, the title may translate to either The Phenomenology of Spirit or The Phenomenology of Mind. In this book, Hegel applied his three-stage dialectical method as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the life of one\u2019s spirit. According to The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \u201c\u2018Dialectics\u2019 is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between the opposing sides.\u201d In Plato\u2019s Republic, he presented a basic form of a dialectic as a back-and-forth argument between Socrates and his students. Socrates posed the question, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d and goes on to refute each student\u2019s answer; forcing each student to refine their belief by adopting Socrates\u2019 refutation and forming a more sophisticated view. A central term in Hegelian dialectics is the verb \u2018aufhebeng\u2019, which, in this context, translates to \u2018to sublate\u2019 or \u2018to cancel and to preserve at the same time\u2019. In Plato\u2019s example, each of Socrates\u2019 student\u2019s original belief is sublated with Socrates\u2019 challenge to adopt the more sophisticated view. The students cancel parts of their original belief while simultaneously preserving sophisticated pieces to combine with Socrates\u2019 challenge. This process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 may happen multiple times within a single \u2018dialectical conflict\u2019.\n\n\nThe fundamental premise of Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to understand history as a sequence of \u2018dialectical conflicts\u2019. The purpose of the Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to achieve spiral evolution of higher thinking by using the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Each conflict begins with what is called the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. This \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment is merely potential for a reality to be actualized. The reality one is concerned with is implicit, or implied, in the moment. The German phrase Hegel used, \u2018an-sich\u2019, directly translates to \u2018in-itself\u2019, but is better understood when colloquially translated to \u2018by-itself\u2019. The reality is \u2018by-itself\u2019, or implicit, in this moment. The reality must be exteriorized, or made explicit, so one can actualize it. In Plato\u2019s The Republic, reality was the adoption of a more sophisticated view. If a student provided an answer to Socrates\u2019 question, the reality would be implicit, or \u2018by-itself\u2019, and not explicit to the student. Without additional information, a student would be unable to form a view more sophisticated than that of their own answer. Additionally, it would be impossible for Socrates to negate the student if the student never initially provided an answer. When Socrates negated their answer, he exteriorized the reality of adopting a more sophisticated view by explicit telling them the more sophisticated view in the form of an argument. The moment in which reality is exteriorized, or explicit, is called the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment. Since dialectics rely on a contradictory process, the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment must negate, or contradict, the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment in order to exteriorize reality. Once reality is explicit, the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 starts and creates an \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment by eliminating flaws from the first two moments and leaving behind ideas and elements that hold true for both. For Plato, the student forms a new, more sophisticated view by disregarding the flaws in their own view while preserving the sophisticated elements in both their own and Socrates\u2019 view. Once complete, the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment serves as the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment for a new dialectical conflict. Hegel believed that by allowing the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment to serve as the next \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment, the dialectical process would result in the spiral evolution of higher thinking because the newly actualized reality would contain potential for another \u2018new reality to be actualized\u2019. For example, once a student adopted the more sophisticated view, Socrates refuted it in the form of an argument, effectively exteriorizing the implicit reality contained in the new \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. A student would proceed to form a more sophisticated view point from an already formed \u2018more sophisticated viewpoint\u2019. Using more simplistic terms, one can understand this process as: problem \u2192 reaction \u2192 solution, where the problem contains an implicit solution and the solution provides a new problem that contains a new implicit solution. Going forward, these three moments will be referred to in accordance with Johann Fichte\u2019s commentary, which uses thesis, antithesis and synthesis in place of \u2018in-itself\u2019, \u2018for-itself\u2019 and \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019.  The most effective way to understand Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to use it to analyze the progression of history.\n \n\nHegel\u2019s dialectic can be used as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 100BCE, Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family that politically aligned itself with plebeian politicians (Watkins). In 84BCE, after his father\u2019s death, Julius Caesar married the daughter of revolutionary Gaius Marius, a Roman general and statesmen who held office of consul seven times. When Lucius Sulla, opponent of Marius, gained control of Rome, he ordered Caesar to divorce his wife. Caesar refused, irrevocably committing himself to the plebeian-popular side of politics in Rome. Caesar fled the anti-revolutionary forces and served in the Roman army until Sulla\u2019s death in 78BCE (Watkins). Once free from Sulla, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and served in government as a prosecution attorney. Caesar\u2019s first major case was against an associate of Sulla but the court was composed of senators who sympathized with Sulla\u2019s anti-revolutionary movement and did not charge the associate. Over the next years, Caesar asserted himself into Roman government, organized a private army to defend attacks from Mithridates VI and worked with Pompey, a former lieutenant of Sulla, to repeal constitutional reform enacted by Sulla himself (Watkins). From 69BCE to 61BCE, Julius Caesar served his term as quaestor in Farther Spain, was elected to the office of aedile and held public festivals in order to solicit support from plebeians. Most importantly, by 59BCE, Caesar had formed an unofficial alliance with his old political friend, Pompey, and another former lieutenant of Sulla, Marcus Crassus (Bishop, 7). Caesar was a popular politician who was known for favoring the common peasant. Pompey was a political and military leader renowned for his victories in Italy and West Asia. Lastly, Marcus Crassus was a property speculator, the largest landowner and richest man in Rome. Angered that the senate constantly threw out their proposed bill, the alliance aimed to overcome the senate\u2019s opposition by influencing Caesar\u2019s election into the consul (Bishop, 7). Despite the senate\u2019s efforts, Caesar is successfully elected in 59BCE and his entrance into the consul marked the beginning of the dialectical conflict. \n\n\nBy challenging the senators, enacting reform and expanding the Republic\u2019s borders, Caesar asserted himself into government and gave potential to actualizing the reality of establishing a new government in place of the Republic. Since this reality was still implicit, as nothing had yet exteriorized it, no one was able to create an entire, new government.  As a member of consul, the first law Caesar introduced distributed government owned land in Italy to the landless poor for the purpose of farming. This law did not receive explicit opposition from the senate, but neither did it receive explicit support (Bishop, 7). In 58BCE, Julius Caesar was designated governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul and Illyria for five years. Wanting dramatic military success, Caesar found an excuse to invade Gaul and earn what he always sought. In 53BCE, at the Battle of Carrhae, Marcus Crassus perished in war, effectively disbanding the alliance and deteriorating the relationship between Caesar and Pompey (Watkins). With Caesar still fighting in Gaul, Pompey revealed to Rome that he was truly ambivalent toward Caesar and proceeded to ally with Caesar\u2019s enemies. The Roman senators demanded Caesar turn over his army\u2019s control to the government, but Caesar chose a civil war over laying down his command. After forcing Pompey to flee and defeating the rest of his troops, Julius Caesar became the prominent figure of the Roman state, where he enforced his power as \u2018dictator in perpetuity\u2019 (Bishop, 7). \n\n\nA group of senators feared for the safety of the Roman Republic so in 44BCE, they conspired against and successfully assassinated Julius Caesar at a senate meeting. Caesar\u2019s removal from government served as the antithesis, or negation, to his assertion into government. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation, this antithesis would be impossible if Caesar initially failed to assert himself over the government. Caesar\u2019s murder caused prominent figures still remaining in the Republic to fight for the right to govern it (Bishop, 8). The potential to create a new form of government had now been exteriorized by Caesar\u2019s death because the remaining figures realized that whoever came out victorious, would govern the Roman Republic and be able to form an entire new government. Finally, fifteen years later, in 29BCE, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus, returned to Rome as the unchallenged ruler of the Republic and started the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Octavianus maintained old republican political institutions by preserving the Senate, popular assemblies, and magisterial offices (Bishop, 8). On the contrary, him and his successors removed parts of the original government and built a system of imperial government that would tend to the empire\u2019s vast territories and connect them with the capital (Bishop, 8). The government Octavianus created, which would come to be known as The Roman Empire, served as the synthesis for Caesar\u2019s assertion into and removal from government by actualizing the original, implicit reality. Just like the politics in the Roman Republic and Empire, the legislation of United States presidencies can be analyzed and understood using Hegel\u2019s dialectic schema.\n\n\nBarack Obama was born in 1961 in the state of Hawaii, just two years after it was officially inaugurated. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School. He became a civil rights attorney while teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago and representing the 13th District for three terms (\u201cPresident Barack Obama.\u201d). Obama gained national attention from his landslide win during the November 2004 Senate election. Four years later, on November 4th, 2008, Obama defeated John McCain in the general election and became the first African American elected to serve as president. Obama was inaugurated on January 20th, 2009 and within the first few minutes, his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order that suspended last-minute executive orders and regulations signed in by outgoing President George W. Bush (\u201cObama Halts All Regulations Pending Review.\u201d). Additionally, he aimed to strengthen relations with the Middle East by immediately calling for what was to be a \u201cnew beginning\u201d between the United States and the Muslim world (\u201cObama in Egypt Reaches out to Muslim World.\u201d). To do this, Obama pursued a military strategy in the Middle East that emphasized drone strikes, special forces and diplomacy over large ground troop operations (Sanger). Just like his first few minutes in office, Obama\u2019s eight years were characterized by significant accomplishments. \n\n\nIn November of 2009, President Obama announced the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement between the United States and 11 other countries, which would bring jobs back to American soil and boost economic trade between the United States and Asia by increasing American exports to the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for forty percent of global trade and includes some of the most robust economies (\u201cObama Administration Accomplishments\u201d). The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate 18,000 different tariffs placed on exporting goods produced domestically. Ninety-five percent of the world\u2019s customers exist outside of the United States\u2019 borders. The United States Trade Representative used a Vietnamese auto parts buyer as an example of a customer. A Vietnamese person would have to pay a twenty-seven percent tax on a part made in the United States but only a five percent tax on a part made in Thailand because of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (\u201cTPP Chapter Summary\u201d). Obama was an advocate for free trade agreements because they allow a country\u2019s exports to increase while creating additional jobs domestically.  \n\n\nMany times, during his presidency, Barack Obama described climate change to be the greatest long-term threat facing the world (Davis). In 2013, Obama bypassed Congress by directly ordering the EPA to place limits on carbon emissions. Additionally, in 2015, Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by twenty-six to twenty-eight percent by the year 2025 (Davenport). Obama\u2019s campaign to fight climate change ended up finding more success at the international level than the national. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly every country in the world agreed to a climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. This deal, the Paris Agreement, was adopted by over 195 countries and attempted to create the, \u201cbridge between today\u2019s policies and climate neutrality before the end of the century\u201d (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). In September 2016, toward the end of Obama\u2019s second term, the United States joined China in participating in the first-ever, universal, legally binding global climate deal (Somander). Collectively, the United States and China contribute to over forty percent of global emissions so successfully entering into this deal with China was a major accomplishment for the Democratic Party. \n\n\nOne of Barack Obama\u2019s most controversial actions during his presidency was when he established policy by a memorandum issued from the Department of Homeland Security. This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and receive a two-year work permit that was renewable if the applicant displayed good behavior. Those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, had come to the United States when they were younger than 16 and lived in the United States since 2007 were eligible to apply (Napolitano). This policy came to be known as the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019, or more commonly, \u2018DACA\u2019. Many republicans opposed this program and denounced it as an abuse of executive power. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted 224 to 201 in favor of defunding the program, but since the program is almost entirely funded by application fees, Congress did not have the power to do so (Werner). DACA continued to be an active program until the end of Obama\u2019s second term. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t elected into the White House because of his experience nor for his role as a party leader. Obama hadn\u2019t served as a governor of a state or as a general in the army. He didn\u2019t even inherit the presidency because of an impeachment or death. Obama was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. \n\n\nDonald Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City. After earning an economic degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Trump purchased his family\u2019s real estate business and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses (\u201cDonald J. Trump.\u201d).  He went on to start various side ventures while making sure he remained in the light of the media. Donald Trump co-authored several books and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality game show on television. Over his years as a businessman, Trump gained notoriety for his racist and sexist views, which he made obvious during his campaign (Baker). Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Like Obama, Trump didn\u2019t win because of his experience in government. Donald Trump was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. In his announcement speech, Trump drew attention to illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism (Trump). After defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. \n\n\nOnce his position as the 45th President of the United States was secured, on November 21st, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy that negotiates \u201cfair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\u201d (\u201cTrump Says US to Quit TPP on First Day in Office.\u201d). As part of this plan, Trump confirmed that the United States intents to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office. Two months later, on January 23rd, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though Trump\u2019s actions were criticized by other politicians like John McCain, Senator Bernie Sanders applauded Trump for pulling out of the partnership. Sanders believes that the Unites States participates in too many free trade agreements, \u201cthat cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019, which has lowered wages for American workers.\u201d (Smith). As recently as January 9th, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced an agenda for the year that is set to replace Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule (Reuters Staff). Additionally, according to the fiscal 2019 proposal released on February 12th, 2018, the United States government plans to reduce the EPA\u2019s budget by $2.5 billion, almost twenty-three percent (Dennis). On March 8, 2018, Donald Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of twenty-five percent on steel and ten percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries (\u201cTrump Tariffs: US President Imposes Levy on Steel and Aluminium.\u201d). Lastly, on September 5th, 2017, Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 program was being repealed. Sessions claimed that the DACA eligible individuals were lawbreakers who adversely impacted the wages and employment of native-born Americans (Smith). Sessions also attributed DACA as a leading cause behind the surge in unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America. Regardless of whether the Trump administration\u2019s decisions were correct, it\u2019s legislative actions are negations of Obama\u2019s implementation of the law. \n\n\nThe implementation of Barack Obama\u2019s policies served as a thesis for this dialectical conflict. Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies will serve as an antithesis for this dialectic. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation and Caesar\u2019s murder, Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies would be impossible if Barack Obama had initially failed to even implement the policies. Currently, the reality one is concerned with is still implicit because it has not been fully exteriorized yet. For reality to be exteriorized, the thesis needs to be fully negated by the antithesis. For example, currently, the Trump administration is having legal issues with the rescission of DACA as it is being challenged in court by fifteen different states. Once the Trump administration is able to completely repeal the actions of the Obama administration, the antithesis will have formed, and reality will become explicit and able to be actualized. If President Trump is able to fully repeal Obama\u2019s policies, the general public should be able to realize that electing a president from the far Right directly after a president from the far Left will make no progress. The general public should understand, in order to make progress, they must elect a president that is able to serve as the synthesis for the dialectic. The general public must elect a president that is moderate, not democratic or republican. The reality one is concerned with here is of a presidency that is a synthesis of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\n\nIf Donald Trump is successful in completely removing Barack Obama\u2019s policies, according to Hegel\u2019s dialectical method, what should result with the next presidency is a synthesis that removes the flaws from Obama\u2019s policies while preserving the superior ideas. The process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 would sublate Obama\u2019s superior ideas with the policies of Trump in order to form what should be a more sophisticated president. If Trump\u2019s modifications to the Environmental Protection Agency results in an overall worsening of the United States\u2019 environmental quality, then the original restrictions placed by Obama would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. Contrarily, if Trump\u2019s repealing of DACA resulted in a lowering of unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America, then Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. This careful analysis would be done for each legislative action taken by either president. Additionally, according to Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution of higher thinking, the next president would serve as the thesis for another dialectical conflict. Through Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution, one is able to eliminate less critical thinking, but must depend on an antithesis to exteriorize reality and actualize higher thinking. One is unable to conclude whether the action taken by the thesis is best serving the country until an antithesis is able to negate that action and exteriorize the implicit reality. The next presidency will be a synthesis of the past two only if President Trump is able to fully negate President Obama\u2019s policies. \n\n\n\n\n \nWorks Cited\n\nBaker, Peter. \u201cA President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation's Racial Fires.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 12 Jan. 2018, www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html.\n\nBishop, Paul A. \u201cRome: Transition from Republic to Empire.\u201d www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf.\n\nDavenport, Coral. \u201cObama's Strategy on Climate Change, Part of Global Deal, Is Revealed.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Mar. 2015, www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html.\n\nDavis, Julie Hirschfeld, et al. \u201cObama on Climate Change: The Trends Are 'Terrifying'.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 8 Sept. 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html.\n\nDennis, Brady. \u201cTrump Budget Seeks 23 Percent Cut at EPA, Eliminating Dozens of Programs.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 12 Feb. 2018, www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/.\n\n\u201cDonald J.

Hear it from him:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://jichikawa.net/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Ichikawa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I defended my PhD dissertation (&amp;quot;Imagination and Epistemology&amp;quot;) in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I&amp;#39;m married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/\"&gt;little while back&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Research Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2013 book, &lt;a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rules of Thought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that &lt;em&gt;no square is a triangle&lt;/em&gt;. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what &lt;em&gt;makes it rational to believe&lt;/em&gt; that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what &lt;em&gt;makes that content the content that it&lt;/em&gt; is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I published my second book, &lt;a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contextualising Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the &lt;em&gt;Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Research Focus&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don&amp;#39;t\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;. (Rhetoric about &amp;quot;not jumping to conclusions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;innocent until proven guilty&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;he said\u2013she said&amp;quot; tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I&amp;#39;m currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly more generally, I&amp;#39;m thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to believe unless certain conditions are met. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t believe if you have insufficient evidence!&amp;quot;) I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!&amp;quot;) There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it&amp;#39;s one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It&amp;#39;s hard to justify activism if you don&amp;#39;t take yourself to know what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional &amp;quot;philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions&amp;quot;\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I prepared a new version of &lt;a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;forall x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a treatment of soundness and completeness. I&amp;#39;ll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources. Given the financial constraints many students face, I think it&amp;#39;s morally important for professors to avoid expensive required textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Bits&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond philosophy, I&amp;#39;m an enthusiastic amateur opera singer, photographer, and long-distance runner. I have a &lt;a href=\"http://instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla\"&gt;cat and a dog who are the best&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;#39;out&amp;#39; in a polyamorous marriage since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been pretty involved in some of the public discourse about the norms of academia and professional philosophy. I played a role a few years back in some faculty expressions of concern about UBC&amp;#39;s treatment of sexual assault allegations, and of UBC governance concerns generally. I&amp;#39;ve also been outspoken about things like journal editorial policies and the &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Gourmet Report&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some famous examples of sexual harassment complaints in philosophy.

Hear it from him:\n\n#[**Jonathan Ichikawa**](http://jichikawa.net/)\n\nI was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.\n\nI defended my PhD dissertation (\"Imagination and Epistemology\") in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I'm married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a [little while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/).)\n\n**Past Research Highlights**:\n\nMy 2013 book, [*The Rules of Thought*](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do)\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that *no square is a triangle*. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what *makes it rational to believe* that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what *makes that content the content that it* is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.\n\nLast year I published my second book, [*Contextualising Knowledge*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;). Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the *Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism*.\n\n**Current Research Focus**:\n\nContextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.\n\nSomething similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don't\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further *proof*. (Rhetoric about \"not jumping to conclusions\", \"innocent until proven guilty\", and \"he said\u2013she said\" tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I'm currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.\n\nSlightly more generally, I'm thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says *not* to believe unless certain conditions are met. (\"Don't believe if you have insufficient evidence!\") I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (\"Don't suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!\") There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it's one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It's hard to justify activism if you don't take yourself to know what's going on.\n\n**Teaching**:\n\nIn addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional \"philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions\"\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.\n\nLast year I prepared a new version of [*forall x*](https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU), an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a treatment of soundness and completeness. I'll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources. Given the financial constraints many students face, I think it's morally important for professors to avoid expensive required textbooks.\n\n**Other Bits**:\n\nBeyond philosophy, I'm an enthusiastic amateur opera singer, photographer, and long-distance runner. I have a [cat and a dog who are the best](http://instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla). I've been 'out' in a polyamorous marriage since 2011.\n\nI've been pretty involved in some of the public discourse about the norms of academia and professional philosophy. I played a role a few years back in some faculty expressions of concern about UBC's treatment of sexual assault allegations, and of UBC governance concerns generally. I've also been outspoken about things like journal editorial policies and the *Philosophical Gourmet Report*, as well as some famous examples of sexual harassment complaints in philosophy. I think it's fair to say I'm a slightly polarising figure within academic philosophy. Usually the trolls only treat me moderately terribly. Some get it far worse than I do.\n\n**Links of Interest**:\n\n* Paper (co-authored): [Rape Culture and Epistemology](https://philpapers.org/rec/CRERCA-2)\n* Book introduction: [What is Epistemic Contextualism?](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHIIE)\n* Book chapter: [Intuition in Contemporary Philosophy](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHIIC)\n* Book chapter (co-authored): [On Putting Knowledge \u2018First\u2019](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHOPK)\n* SEP article (co-authored): [The Analysis of Knowledge](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/)\n* Paper: [Dreaming and Imagination](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHDAI)\n* Magazine piece (co-authored): [On Being the Only Ones](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgaw1sxphy1zev4/On%20Being%20The%20Only%20Ones.pdf)\n* Blog post: [Facts, Alternative Facts, and Definitions](http://blog.jichikawa.net/2017/01/facts-alternative-facts-and-definitions.html)\n\n\n**AMA**\n\nPlease feel free to post questions for Professor Ichikawa here.

This made me realise important difference between a normal program and a neural network. It this short essay, i will argue why a neural network is an automated opinion, which is something, in my opinion, essential to solving all the other problem regarding AI\u2019s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The difference&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Past computer programs were in either a way for us to interact with computers, or an atomisation of a task. These programs are given a set of rules to act on by the programmer. Now there is a new way to automate the tasks: the neural network. \nIt, however, creates its own rules. It looks for itself what the most efficient way is. It has a view for it self on how to solve an issue. A neural network projects its own view on every problem, to find the most efficient way.\nOnly the inputs and outputs of the neural network can be looked at, and if given a way to measure if the output is good or bad, the efficiency can be measured, but it is not possible at this moment to understand why it comes to a certain conclusion. Its view is thus closed of and private.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A neural network has a goal. I make decisions because I want to reach a goal, if I&amp;#39;d not make decisions according to my goal, my decision would be random, like at the start of the neural network. You could say that the neural networks goal is to be right, to tell the truth.\nWhen I tell a trained a neural network on dog and cats, gets a picture of a cat, it makes a choice, this choice is in accordance with its goal. \nI do not say a neural network wants to reach this goal. I do not say it is making a conscious choice.\nBut it has two options and the answer is only one, so a choice has been made, and this choice is in accordance with its goal of telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;A view&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it makes a choice, in accordance with its goals. Every choice that is not random presupposes a way to judge whatever is at hand, since the choices of the AI are not random, but in accordance with a goal. The AI has learned on what parts of the picture to pay attention to, it is its way to judge the picture. This judgement is not based on what the programer says, like with normal programs, but on what the program shaped itself with outside input. A view is something we shape ourselves, with outside input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;opinion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The definition of opinion according to the dictionary (&lt;a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion\"&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion&lt;/a&gt;) is a  personal  view,  attitude,  or  appraisal. Personal meaning here of,  relating  to,  or  coming  as  from  a  particular  person;  individual; private; (&lt;a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/personal?s=t\"&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/personal?s=t&lt;/a&gt;).\nA neural network has a private view, an opinion on the subject. It is not like a normal program, a mere module that automates tasks, it is an automated opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Opinions only for humans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A possible refute of this conclusion is that the definition of opinion also point at a human actor that has to be in the equation, due to the implied humanness of the word personal comes from the french word personal, which means pertaining to the self (&lt;a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/personal\"&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/personal&lt;/a&gt;). In this case the view of the neural network is only something that pertains to itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Human opinion vs Machine opinions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a difference between the opinions of the machines and the opinions of the human? At this point in time I&amp;#39;d say there still is. Machines can only form opinions, at this moment, from a predetermined set of parameters, where humans can theoraticaly rasp an infinite set. The biggest difference I think there is, is that at this moment machines cannot argue their opinions. The only argument that can be used for the validity of machines opinion is the ability to measure the percentage of times its outputs are in line with reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Alignment with reality&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of theories that can explain a lot of things, and still would be called untrue. An example of this is aristotle&amp;#39;s elements theory. He stated that certain elements either want to go up or down. He classified fire as something that wants to go up, and 100% of the time, fire went up. If a neural network came up with this theory, it would have a 100% success rate, even though its reason - even though I could of course not grasp the complexity of aristotle&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; argument in a few lines - is faulty.\nThe problem with only being able see the verification is, that it explains nothing, it just gives answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I am of the opinion, that the neural network just expresses an opinion, which can not be argued for yet, so should be regarded as something to neither dismiss or approve. I wonder what you guys think of my observation? Do you think it has any truth to it or not, and mostly why. Do you think, like me, that this, if true, could have implications on almost every espects of the philosophical problems adressing AI&amp;#39;s?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I do not say it is making a conscious choice.\nBut it has two options and the answer is only one, so a choice has been made, and this choice is in accordance with its goal of telling the truth.\n\n## A view\nIf it makes a choice, in accordance with its goals. Every choice that is not random presupposes a way to judge whatever is at hand, since the choices of the AI are not random, but in accordance with a goal. The AI has learned on what parts of the picture to pay attention to, it is its way to judge the picture. This judgement is not based on what the programer says, like with normal programs, but on what the program shaped itself with outside input. A view is something we shape ourselves, with outside input.\n\n# opinion\nThe definition of opinion according to the dictionary (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/opinion) is a  personal  view,  attitude,  or  appraisal. Personal meaning here of,  relating  to,  or  coming  as  from  a  particular  person;  individual; private; (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/personal?s=t).\nA neural network has a private view, an opinion on the subject. It is not like a normal program, a mere module that automates tasks, it is an automated opinion.\n\n## Opinions only for humans\nA possible refute of this conclusion is that the definition of opinion also point at a human actor that has to be in the equation, due to the implied humanness of the word personal comes from the french word personal, which means pertaining to the self (https://www.etymonline.com/word/personal). In this case the view of the neural network is only something that pertains to itself.\n\n## Human opinion vs Machine opinions\nIs there a difference between the opinions of the machines and the opinions of the human? At this point in time I'd say there still is. Machines can only form opinions, at this moment, from a predetermined set of parameters, where humans can theoraticaly rasp an infinite set. The biggest difference I think there is, is that at this moment machines cannot argue their opinions. The only argument that can be used for the validity of machines opinion is the ability to measure the percentage of times its outputs are in line with reality.\n\n## Alignment with reality\nThere are a lot of theories that can explain a lot of things, and still would be called untrue. An example of this is aristotle's elements theory. He stated that certain elements either want to go up or down. He classified fire as something that wants to go up, and 100% of the time, fire went up. If a neural network came up with this theory, it would have a 100% success rate, even though its reason - even though I could of course not grasp the complexity of aristotle's' argument in a few lines - is faulty.\nThe problem with only being able see the verification is, that it explains nothing, it just gives answers.\n\nThis is why I am of the opinion, that the neural network just expresses an opinion, which can not be argued for yet, so should be regarded as something to neither dismiss or approve. I wonder what you guys think of my observation? Do you think it has any truth to it or not, and mostly why. Do you think, like me, that this, if true, could have implications on almost every espects of the philosophical problems adressing AI's?\n\n\n",

It is an upper division general education course. I started doing research about a week before but realized on Sunday that I did not actually completely understand the dialectic process. I\u2019m still not sure if I have correctly. I started writing Sunday at 12pm, wrote until 6am, slept, continued at 10am and submitted it at 4pm on Monday. If I had done this a week ago, I could have asked my professor for feedback but I am taking the class credit/not credit so I just needed to pass. Also, I\u2019m a terrible procrastinator. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcomed!!! :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I just realized I was braindead upon finishing and didn\u2019t proofread. Sorry for the mess. I will fix it tomorrow. \n~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 \u2013 1831) was a predominant figure in 19th century German philosophy. He contributed widely to German Idealism, a philosophical movement spurred as a reaction to Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Generally, idealism is the theory that fundamental reality is made up of one\u2019s thoughts or ideas. It holds that one cannot be certain that any matter of the outside world exists and that the only thing truly knowable is consciousness. Hegel achieved significant renown in his day, given his first book, Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes, was his most thoroughly discussed philosophical work. Since the German word \u2018geist\u2019 is understood through multiple definitions, the title may translate to either The Phenomenology of Spirit or The Phenomenology of Mind. In this book, Hegel applied his three-stage dialectical method as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the life of one\u2019s spirit. According to The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \u201c\u2018Dialectics\u2019 is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between the opposing sides.\u201d In Plato\u2019s Republic, he presented a basic form of a dialectic as a back-and-forth argument between Socrates and his students. Socrates posed the question, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d and goes on to refute each student\u2019s answer; forcing each student to refine their belief by adopting Socrates\u2019 refutation and forming a more sophisticated view. A central term in Hegelian dialectics is the verb \u2018aufhebeng\u2019, which, in this context, translates to \u2018to sublate\u2019 or \u2018to cancel and to preserve at the same time\u2019. In Plato\u2019s example, each of Socrates\u2019 student\u2019s original belief is sublated with Socrates\u2019 challenge to adopt the more sophisticated view. The students cancel parts of their original belief while simultaneously preserving sophisticated pieces to combine with Socrates\u2019 challenge. This process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 may happen multiple times within a single \u2018dialectical conflict\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fundamental premise of Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to understand history as a sequence of \u2018dialectical conflicts\u2019. The purpose of the Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to achieve spiral evolution of higher thinking by using the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Each conflict begins with what is called the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. This \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment is merely potential for a reality to be actualized. The reality one is concerned with is implicit, or implied, in the moment. The German phrase Hegel used, \u2018an-sich\u2019, directly translates to \u2018in-itself\u2019, but is better understood when colloquially translated to \u2018by-itself\u2019. The reality is \u2018by-itself\u2019, or implicit, in this moment. The reality must be exteriorized, or made explicit, so one can actualize it. In Plato\u2019s The Republic, reality was the adoption of a more sophisticated view. If a student provided an answer to Socrates\u2019 question, the reality would be implicit, or \u2018by-itself\u2019, and not explicit to the student. Without additional information, a student would be unable to form a view more sophisticated than that of their own answer. Additionally, it would be impossible for Socrates to negate the student if the student never initially provided an answer. When Socrates negated their answer, he exteriorized the reality of adopting a more sophisticated view by explicit telling them the more sophisticated view in the form of an argument. The moment in which reality is exteriorized, or explicit, is called the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment. Since dialectics rely on a contradictory process, the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment must negate, or contradict, the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment in order to exteriorize reality. Once reality is explicit, the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 starts and creates an \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment by eliminating flaws from the first two moments and leaving behind ideas and elements that hold true for both. For Plato, the student forms a new, more sophisticated view by disregarding the flaws in their own view while preserving the sophisticated elements in both their own and Socrates\u2019 view. Once complete, the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment serves as the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment for a new dialectical conflict. Hegel believed that by allowing the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment to serve as the next \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment, the dialectical process would result in the spiral evolution of higher thinking because the newly actualized reality would contain potential for another \u2018new reality to be actualized\u2019. For example, once a student adopted the more sophisticated view, Socrates refuted it in the form of an argument, effectively exteriorizing the implicit reality contained in the new \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. A student would proceed to form a more sophisticated view point from an already formed \u2018more sophisticated viewpoint\u2019. Using more simplistic terms, one can understand this process as: problem \u2192 reaction \u2192 solution, where the problem contains an implicit solution and the solution provides a new problem that contains a new implicit solution. Going forward, these three moments will be referred to in accordance with Johann Fichte\u2019s commentary, which uses thesis, antithesis and synthesis in place of \u2018in-itself\u2019, \u2018for-itself\u2019 and \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019.  The most effective way to understand Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to use it to analyze the progression of history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hegel\u2019s dialectic can be used as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 100BCE, Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family that politically aligned itself with plebeian politicians (Watkins). In 84BCE, after his father\u2019s death, Julius Caesar married the daughter of revolutionary Gaius Marius, a Roman general and statesmen who held office of consul seven times. When Lucius Sulla, opponent of Marius, gained control of Rome, he ordered Caesar to divorce his wife. Caesar refused, irrevocably committing himself to the plebeian-popular side of politics in Rome. Caesar fled the anti-revolutionary forces and served in the Roman army until Sulla\u2019s death in 78BCE (Watkins). Once free from Sulla, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and served in government as a prosecution attorney. Caesar\u2019s first major case was against an associate of Sulla but the court was composed of senators who sympathized with Sulla\u2019s anti-revolutionary movement and did not charge the associate. Over the next years, Caesar asserted himself into Roman government, organized a private army to defend attacks from Mithridates VI and worked with Pompey, a former lieutenant of Sulla, to repeal constitutional reform enacted by Sulla himself (Watkins). From 69BCE to 61BCE, Julius Caesar served his term as quaestor in Farther Spain, was elected to the office of aedile and held public festivals in order to solicit support from plebeians. Most importantly, by 59BCE, Caesar had formed an unofficial alliance with his old political friend, Pompey, and another former lieutenant of Sulla, Marcus Crassus (Bishop, 7). Caesar was a popular politician who was known for favoring the common peasant. Pompey was a political and military leader renowned for his victories in Italy and West Asia. Lastly, Marcus Crassus was a property speculator, the largest landowner and richest man in Rome. Angered that the senate constantly threw out their proposed bill, the alliance aimed to overcome the senate\u2019s opposition by influencing Caesar\u2019s election into the consul (Bishop, 7). Despite the senate\u2019s efforts, Caesar is successfully elected in 59BCE and his entrance into the consul marked the beginning of the dialectical conflict. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By challenging the senators, enacting reform and expanding the Republic\u2019s borders, Caesar asserted himself into government and gave potential to actualizing the reality of establishing a new government in place of the Republic. Since this reality was still implicit, as nothing had yet exteriorized it, no one was able to create an entire, new government.  As a member of consul, the first law Caesar introduced distributed government owned land in Italy to the landless poor for the purpose of farming. This law did not receive explicit opposition from the senate, but neither did it receive explicit support (Bishop, 7). In 58BCE, Julius Caesar was designated governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul and Illyria for five years. Wanting dramatic military success, Caesar found an excuse to invade Gaul and earn what he always sought. In 53BCE, at the Battle of Carrhae, Marcus Crassus perished in war, effectively disbanding the alliance and deteriorating the relationship between Caesar and Pompey (Watkins). With Caesar still fighting in Gaul, Pompey revealed to Rome that he was truly ambivalent toward Caesar and proceeded to ally with Caesar\u2019s enemies. The Roman senators demanded Caesar turn over his army\u2019s control to the government, but Caesar chose a civil war over laying down his command. After forcing Pompey to flee and defeating the rest of his troops, Julius Caesar became the prominent figure of the Roman state, where he enforced his power as \u2018dictator in perpetuity\u2019 (Bishop, 7). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A group of senators feared for the safety of the Roman Republic so in 44BCE, they conspired against and successfully assassinated Julius Caesar at a senate meeting. Caesar\u2019s removal from government served as the antithesis, or negation, to his assertion into government. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation, this antithesis would be impossible if Caesar initially failed to assert himself over the government. Caesar\u2019s murder caused prominent figures still remaining in the Republic to fight for the right to govern it (Bishop, 8). The potential to create a new form of government had now been exteriorized by Caesar\u2019s death because the remaining figures realized that whoever came out victorious, would govern the Roman Republic and be able to form an entire new government. Finally, fifteen years later, in 29BCE, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus, returned to Rome as the unchallenged ruler of the Republic and started the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Octavianus maintained old republican political institutions by preserving the Senate, popular assemblies, and magisterial offices (Bishop, 8). On the contrary, him and his successors removed parts of the original government and built a system of imperial government that would tend to the empire\u2019s vast territories and connect them with the capital (Bishop, 8). The government Octavianus created, which would come to be known as The Roman Empire, served as the synthesis for Caesar\u2019s assertion into and removal from government by actualizing the original, implicit reality. Just like the politics in the Roman Republic and Empire, the legislation of United States presidencies can be analyzed and understood using Hegel\u2019s dialectic schema.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama was born in 1961 in the state of Hawaii, just two years after it was officially inaugurated. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School. He became a civil rights attorney while teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago and representing the 13th District for three terms (\u201cPresident Barack Obama.\u201d). Obama gained national attention from his landslide win during the November 2004 Senate election. Four years later, on November 4th, 2008, Obama defeated John McCain in the general election and became the first African American elected to serve as president. Obama was inaugurated on January 20th, 2009 and within the first few minutes, his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order that suspended last-minute executive orders and regulations signed in by outgoing President George W. Bush (\u201cObama Halts All Regulations Pending Review.\u201d). Additionally, he aimed to strengthen relations with the Middle East by immediately calling for what was to be a \u201cnew beginning\u201d between the United States and the Muslim world (\u201cObama in Egypt Reaches out to Muslim World.\u201d). To do this, Obama pursued a military strategy in the Middle East that emphasized drone strikes, special forces and diplomacy over large ground troop operations (Sanger). Just like his first few minutes in office, Obama\u2019s eight years were characterized by significant accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In November of 2009, President Obama announced the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement between the United States and 11 other countries, which would bring jobs back to American soil and boost economic trade between the United States and Asia by increasing American exports to the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for forty percent of global trade and includes some of the most robust economies (\u201cObama Administration Accomplishments\u201d). The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate 18,000 different tariffs placed on exporting goods produced domestically. Ninety-five percent of the world\u2019s customers exist outside of the United States\u2019 borders. The United States Trade Representative used a Vietnamese auto parts buyer as an example of a customer. A Vietnamese person would have to pay a twenty-seven percent tax on a part made in the United States but only a five percent tax on a part made in Thailand because of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (\u201cTPP Chapter Summary\u201d). Obama was an advocate for free trade agreements because they allow a country\u2019s exports to increase while creating additional jobs domestically.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many times, during his presidency, Barack Obama described climate change to be the greatest long-term threat facing the world (Davis). In 2013, Obama bypassed Congress by directly ordering the EPA to place limits on carbon emissions. Additionally, in 2015, Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by twenty-six to twenty-eight percent by the year 2025 (Davenport). Obama\u2019s campaign to fight climate change ended up finding more success at the international level than the national. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly every country in the world agreed to a climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. This deal, the Paris Agreement, was adopted by over 195 countries and attempted to create the, \u201cbridge between today\u2019s policies and climate neutrality before the end of the century\u201d (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). In September 2016, toward the end of Obama\u2019s second term, the United States joined China in participating in the first-ever, universal, legally binding global climate deal (Somander). Collectively, the United States and China contribute to over forty percent of global emissions so successfully entering into this deal with China was a major accomplishment for the Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of Barack Obama\u2019s most controversial actions during his presidency was when he established policy by a memorandum issued from the Department of Homeland Security. This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and receive a two-year work permit that was renewable if the applicant displayed good behavior. Those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, had come to the United States when they were younger than 16 and lived in the United States since 2007 were eligible to apply (Napolitano). This policy came to be known as the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019, or more commonly, \u2018DACA\u2019. Many republicans opposed this program and denounced it as an abuse of executive power. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted 224 to 201 in favor of defunding the program, but since the program is almost entirely funded by application fees, Congress did not have the power to do so (Werner). DACA continued to be an active program until the end of Obama\u2019s second term. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t elected into the White House because of his experience nor for his role as a party leader. Obama hadn\u2019t served as a governor of a state or as a general in the army. He didn\u2019t even inherit the presidency because of an impeachment or death. Obama was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City. After earning an economic degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Trump purchased his family\u2019s real estate business and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses (\u201cDonald J. Trump.\u201d).  He went on to start various side ventures while making sure he remained in the light of the media. Donald Trump co-authored several books and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality game show on television. Over his years as a businessman, Trump gained notoriety for his racist and sexist views, which he made obvious during his campaign (Baker). Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Like Obama, Trump didn\u2019t win because of his experience in government. Donald Trump was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. In his announcement speech, Trump drew attention to illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism (Trump). After defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once his position as the 45th President of the United States was secured, on November 21st, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy that negotiates \u201cfair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\u201d (\u201cTrump Says US to Quit TPP on First Day in Office.\u201d). As part of this plan, Trump confirmed that the United States intents to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office. Two months later, on January 23rd, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though Trump\u2019s actions were criticized by other politicians like John McCain, Senator Bernie Sanders applauded Trump for pulling out of the partnership. Sanders believes that the Unites States participates in too many free trade agreements, \u201cthat cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019, which has lowered wages for American workers.\u201d (Smith). As recently as January 9th, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced an agenda for the year that is set to replace Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule (Reuters Staff). Additionally, according to the fiscal 2019 proposal released on February 12th, 2018, the United States government plans to reduce the EPA\u2019s budget by $2.5 billion, almost twenty-three percent (Dennis). On March 8, 2018, Donald Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of twenty-five percent on steel and ten percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries (\u201cTrump Tariffs: US President Imposes Levy on Steel and Aluminium.\u201d). Lastly, on September 5th, 2017, Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 program was being repealed. Sessions claimed that the DACA eligible individuals were lawbreakers who adversely impacted the wages and employment of native-born Americans (Smith). Sessions also attributed DACA as a leading cause behind the surge in unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America. Regardless of whether the Trump administration\u2019s decisions were correct, it\u2019s legislative actions are negations of Obama\u2019s implementation of the law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implementation of Barack Obama\u2019s policies served as a thesis for this dialectical conflict. Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies will serve as an antithesis for this dialectic. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation and Caesar\u2019s murder, Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies would be impossible if Barack Obama had initially failed to even implement the policies. Currently, the reality one is concerned with is still implicit because it has not been fully exteriorized yet. For reality to be exteriorized, the thesis needs to be fully negated by the antithesis. For example, currently, the Trump administration is having legal issues with the rescission of DACA as it is being challenged in court by fifteen different states. Once the Trump administration is able to completely repeal the actions of the Obama administration, the antithesis will have formed, and reality will become explicit and able to be actualized. If President Trump is able to fully repeal Obama\u2019s policies, the general public should be able to realize that electing a president from the far Right directly after a president from the far Left will make no progress. The general public should understand, in order to make progress, they must elect a president that is able to serve as the synthesis for the dialectic. The general public must elect a president that is moderate, not democratic or republican. The reality one is concerned with here is of a presidency that is a synthesis of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Donald Trump is successful in completely removing Barack Obama\u2019s policies, according to Hegel\u2019s dialectical method, what should result with the next presidency is a synthesis that removes the flaws from Obama\u2019s policies while preserving the superior ideas. The process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 would sublate Obama\u2019s superior ideas with the policies of Trump in order to form what should be a more sophisticated president. If Trump\u2019s modifications to the Environmental Protection Agency results in an overall worsening of the United States\u2019 environmental quality, then the original restrictions placed by Obama would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. Contrarily, if Trump\u2019s repealing of DACA resulted in a lowering of unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America, then Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. This careful analysis would be done for each legislative action taken by either president. Additionally, according to Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution of higher thinking, the next president would serve as the thesis for another dialectical conflict. Through Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution, one is able to eliminate less critical thinking, but must depend on an antithesis to exteriorize reality and actualize higher thinking. One is unable to conclude whether the action taken by the thesis is best serving the country until an antithesis is able to negate that action and exteriorize the implicit reality. The next presidency will be a synthesis of the past two only if President Trump is able to fully negate President Obama\u2019s policies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works Cited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baker, Peter. \u201cA President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation&amp;#39;s Racial Fires.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 12 Jan. 2018, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bishop, Paul A. \u201cRome: Transition from Republic to Empire.\u201d &lt;a href=\"http://www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf\"&gt;www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davenport, Coral. \u201cObama&amp;#39;s Strategy on Climate Change, Part of Global Deal, Is Revealed.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Mar. 2015, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis, Julie Hirschfeld, et al. \u201cObama on Climate Change: The Trends Are &amp;#39;Terrifying&amp;#39;.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 8 Sept. 2016, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html\"&gt;www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dennis, Brady. \u201cTrump Budget Seeks 23 Percent Cut at EPA, Eliminating Dozens of Programs.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 12 Feb. 2018, &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/\"&gt;www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cDonald J.

It is an upper division general education course. I started doing research about a week before but realized on Sunday that I did not actually completely understand the dialectic process. I\u2019m still not sure if I have correctly. I started writing Sunday at 12pm, wrote until 6am, slept, continued at 10am and submitted it at 4pm on Monday. If I had done this a week ago, I could have asked my professor for feedback but I am taking the class credit/not credit so I just needed to pass. Also, I\u2019m a terrible procrastinator. \n\nFeedback is welcomed!!! :) \n\nedit: I just realized I was braindead upon finishing and didn\u2019t proofread. Sorry for the mess. I will fix it tomorrow. \n~~\n\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 \u2013 1831) was a predominant figure in 19th century German philosophy. He contributed widely to German Idealism, a philosophical movement spurred as a reaction to Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Generally, idealism is the theory that fundamental reality is made up of one\u2019s thoughts or ideas. It holds that one cannot be certain that any matter of the outside world exists and that the only thing truly knowable is consciousness. Hegel achieved significant renown in his day, given his first book, Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes, was his most thoroughly discussed philosophical work. Since the German word \u2018geist\u2019 is understood through multiple definitions, the title may translate to either The Phenomenology of Spirit or The Phenomenology of Mind. In this book, Hegel applied his three-stage dialectical method as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the life of one\u2019s spirit. According to The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \u201c\u2018Dialectics\u2019 is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between the opposing sides.\u201d In Plato\u2019s Republic, he presented a basic form of a dialectic as a back-and-forth argument between Socrates and his students. Socrates posed the question, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d and goes on to refute each student\u2019s answer; forcing each student to refine their belief by adopting Socrates\u2019 refutation and forming a more sophisticated view. A central term in Hegelian dialectics is the verb \u2018aufhebeng\u2019, which, in this context, translates to \u2018to sublate\u2019 or \u2018to cancel and to preserve at the same time\u2019. In Plato\u2019s example, each of Socrates\u2019 student\u2019s original belief is sublated with Socrates\u2019 challenge to adopt the more sophisticated view. The students cancel parts of their original belief while simultaneously preserving sophisticated pieces to combine with Socrates\u2019 challenge. This process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 may happen multiple times within a single \u2018dialectical conflict\u2019.\n\n\nThe fundamental premise of Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to understand history as a sequence of \u2018dialectical conflicts\u2019. The purpose of the Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to achieve spiral evolution of higher thinking by using the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Each conflict begins with what is called the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. This \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment is merely potential for a reality to be actualized. The reality one is concerned with is implicit, or implied, in the moment. The German phrase Hegel used, \u2018an-sich\u2019, directly translates to \u2018in-itself\u2019, but is better understood when colloquially translated to \u2018by-itself\u2019. The reality is \u2018by-itself\u2019, or implicit, in this moment. The reality must be exteriorized, or made explicit, so one can actualize it. In Plato\u2019s The Republic, reality was the adoption of a more sophisticated view. If a student provided an answer to Socrates\u2019 question, the reality would be implicit, or \u2018by-itself\u2019, and not explicit to the student. Without additional information, a student would be unable to form a view more sophisticated than that of their own answer. Additionally, it would be impossible for Socrates to negate the student if the student never initially provided an answer. When Socrates negated their answer, he exteriorized the reality of adopting a more sophisticated view by explicit telling them the more sophisticated view in the form of an argument. The moment in which reality is exteriorized, or explicit, is called the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment. Since dialectics rely on a contradictory process, the \u2018for-itself\u2019 moment must negate, or contradict, the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment in order to exteriorize reality. Once reality is explicit, the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 starts and creates an \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment by eliminating flaws from the first two moments and leaving behind ideas and elements that hold true for both. For Plato, the student forms a new, more sophisticated view by disregarding the flaws in their own view while preserving the sophisticated elements in both their own and Socrates\u2019 view. Once complete, the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment serves as the \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment for a new dialectical conflict. Hegel believed that by allowing the \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019 moment to serve as the next \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment, the dialectical process would result in the spiral evolution of higher thinking because the newly actualized reality would contain potential for another \u2018new reality to be actualized\u2019. For example, once a student adopted the more sophisticated view, Socrates refuted it in the form of an argument, effectively exteriorizing the implicit reality contained in the new \u2018in-itself\u2019 moment. A student would proceed to form a more sophisticated view point from an already formed \u2018more sophisticated viewpoint\u2019. Using more simplistic terms, one can understand this process as: problem \u2192 reaction \u2192 solution, where the problem contains an implicit solution and the solution provides a new problem that contains a new implicit solution. Going forward, these three moments will be referred to in accordance with Johann Fichte\u2019s commentary, which uses thesis, antithesis and synthesis in place of \u2018in-itself\u2019, \u2018for-itself\u2019 and \u2018in-and-for-itself\u2019.  The most effective way to understand Hegel\u2019s dialectic method is to use it to analyze the progression of history.\n \n\nHegel\u2019s dialectic can be used as an interpretive schema to understand and analyze the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 100BCE, Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family that politically aligned itself with plebeian politicians (Watkins). In 84BCE, after his father\u2019s death, Julius Caesar married the daughter of revolutionary Gaius Marius, a Roman general and statesmen who held office of consul seven times. When Lucius Sulla, opponent of Marius, gained control of Rome, he ordered Caesar to divorce his wife. Caesar refused, irrevocably committing himself to the plebeian-popular side of politics in Rome. Caesar fled the anti-revolutionary forces and served in the Roman army until Sulla\u2019s death in 78BCE (Watkins). Once free from Sulla, Julius Caesar returned to Rome and served in government as a prosecution attorney. Caesar\u2019s first major case was against an associate of Sulla but the court was composed of senators who sympathized with Sulla\u2019s anti-revolutionary movement and did not charge the associate. Over the next years, Caesar asserted himself into Roman government, organized a private army to defend attacks from Mithridates VI and worked with Pompey, a former lieutenant of Sulla, to repeal constitutional reform enacted by Sulla himself (Watkins). From 69BCE to 61BCE, Julius Caesar served his term as quaestor in Farther Spain, was elected to the office of aedile and held public festivals in order to solicit support from plebeians. Most importantly, by 59BCE, Caesar had formed an unofficial alliance with his old political friend, Pompey, and another former lieutenant of Sulla, Marcus Crassus (Bishop, 7). Caesar was a popular politician who was known for favoring the common peasant. Pompey was a political and military leader renowned for his victories in Italy and West Asia. Lastly, Marcus Crassus was a property speculator, the largest landowner and richest man in Rome. Angered that the senate constantly threw out their proposed bill, the alliance aimed to overcome the senate\u2019s opposition by influencing Caesar\u2019s election into the consul (Bishop, 7). Despite the senate\u2019s efforts, Caesar is successfully elected in 59BCE and his entrance into the consul marked the beginning of the dialectical conflict. \n\n\nBy challenging the senators, enacting reform and expanding the Republic\u2019s borders, Caesar asserted himself into government and gave potential to actualizing the reality of establishing a new government in place of the Republic. Since this reality was still implicit, as nothing had yet exteriorized it, no one was able to create an entire, new government.  As a member of consul, the first law Caesar introduced distributed government owned land in Italy to the landless poor for the purpose of farming. This law did not receive explicit opposition from the senate, but neither did it receive explicit support (Bishop, 7). In 58BCE, Julius Caesar was designated governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul and Illyria for five years. Wanting dramatic military success, Caesar found an excuse to invade Gaul and earn what he always sought. In 53BCE, at the Battle of Carrhae, Marcus Crassus perished in war, effectively disbanding the alliance and deteriorating the relationship between Caesar and Pompey (Watkins). With Caesar still fighting in Gaul, Pompey revealed to Rome that he was truly ambivalent toward Caesar and proceeded to ally with Caesar\u2019s enemies. The Roman senators demanded Caesar turn over his army\u2019s control to the government, but Caesar chose a civil war over laying down his command. After forcing Pompey to flee and defeating the rest of his troops, Julius Caesar became the prominent figure of the Roman state, where he enforced his power as \u2018dictator in perpetuity\u2019 (Bishop, 7). \n\n\nA group of senators feared for the safety of the Roman Republic so in 44BCE, they conspired against and successfully assassinated Julius Caesar at a senate meeting. Caesar\u2019s removal from government served as the antithesis, or negation, to his assertion into government. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation, this antithesis would be impossible if Caesar initially failed to assert himself over the government. Caesar\u2019s murder caused prominent figures still remaining in the Republic to fight for the right to govern it (Bishop, 8). The potential to create a new form of government had now been exteriorized by Caesar\u2019s death because the remaining figures realized that whoever came out victorious, would govern the Roman Republic and be able to form an entire new government. Finally, fifteen years later, in 29BCE, Caesar\u2019s great-nephew, Gaius Octavianus, returned to Rome as the unchallenged ruler of the Republic and started the process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019. Octavianus maintained old republican political institutions by preserving the Senate, popular assemblies, and magisterial offices (Bishop, 8). On the contrary, him and his successors removed parts of the original government and built a system of imperial government that would tend to the empire\u2019s vast territories and connect them with the capital (Bishop, 8). The government Octavianus created, which would come to be known as The Roman Empire, served as the synthesis for Caesar\u2019s assertion into and removal from government by actualizing the original, implicit reality. Just like the politics in the Roman Republic and Empire, the legislation of United States presidencies can be analyzed and understood using Hegel\u2019s dialectic schema.\n\n\nBarack Obama was born in 1961 in the state of Hawaii, just two years after it was officially inaugurated. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School. He became a civil rights attorney while teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago and representing the 13th District for three terms (\u201cPresident Barack Obama.\u201d). Obama gained national attention from his landslide win during the November 2004 Senate election. Four years later, on November 4th, 2008, Obama defeated John McCain in the general election and became the first African American elected to serve as president. Obama was inaugurated on January 20th, 2009 and within the first few minutes, his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, issued an order that suspended last-minute executive orders and regulations signed in by outgoing President George W. Bush (\u201cObama Halts All Regulations Pending Review.\u201d). Additionally, he aimed to strengthen relations with the Middle East by immediately calling for what was to be a \u201cnew beginning\u201d between the United States and the Muslim world (\u201cObama in Egypt Reaches out to Muslim World.\u201d). To do this, Obama pursued a military strategy in the Middle East that emphasized drone strikes, special forces and diplomacy over large ground troop operations (Sanger). Just like his first few minutes in office, Obama\u2019s eight years were characterized by significant accomplishments. \n\n\nIn November of 2009, President Obama announced the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement between the United States and 11 other countries, which would bring jobs back to American soil and boost economic trade between the United States and Asia by increasing American exports to the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for forty percent of global trade and includes some of the most robust economies (\u201cObama Administration Accomplishments\u201d). The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate 18,000 different tariffs placed on exporting goods produced domestically. Ninety-five percent of the world\u2019s customers exist outside of the United States\u2019 borders. The United States Trade Representative used a Vietnamese auto parts buyer as an example of a customer. A Vietnamese person would have to pay a twenty-seven percent tax on a part made in the United States but only a five percent tax on a part made in Thailand because of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (\u201cTPP Chapter Summary\u201d). Obama was an advocate for free trade agreements because they allow a country\u2019s exports to increase while creating additional jobs domestically.  \n\n\nMany times, during his presidency, Barack Obama described climate change to be the greatest long-term threat facing the world (Davis). In 2013, Obama bypassed Congress by directly ordering the EPA to place limits on carbon emissions. Additionally, in 2015, Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by twenty-six to twenty-eight percent by the year 2025 (Davenport). Obama\u2019s campaign to fight climate change ended up finding more success at the international level than the national. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly every country in the world agreed to a climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. This deal, the Paris Agreement, was adopted by over 195 countries and attempted to create the, \u201cbridge between today\u2019s policies and climate neutrality before the end of the century\u201d (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). In September 2016, toward the end of Obama\u2019s second term, the United States joined China in participating in the first-ever, universal, legally binding global climate deal (Somander). Collectively, the United States and China contribute to over forty percent of global emissions so successfully entering into this deal with China was a major accomplishment for the Democratic Party. \n\n\nOne of Barack Obama\u2019s most controversial actions during his presidency was when he established policy by a memorandum issued from the Department of Homeland Security. This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and receive a two-year work permit that was renewable if the applicant displayed good behavior. Those who were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, had come to the United States when they were younger than 16 and lived in the United States since 2007 were eligible to apply (Napolitano). This policy came to be known as the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019, or more commonly, \u2018DACA\u2019. Many republicans opposed this program and denounced it as an abuse of executive power. In 2013, the House of Representatives voted 224 to 201 in favor of defunding the program, but since the program is almost entirely funded by application fees, Congress did not have the power to do so (Werner). DACA continued to be an active program until the end of Obama\u2019s second term. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t elected into the White House because of his experience nor for his role as a party leader. Obama hadn\u2019t served as a governor of a state or as a general in the army. He didn\u2019t even inherit the presidency because of an impeachment or death. Obama was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. \n\n\nDonald Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City. After earning an economic degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Trump purchased his family\u2019s real estate business and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses (\u201cDonald J. Trump.\u201d).  He went on to start various side ventures while making sure he remained in the light of the media. Donald Trump co-authored several books and produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality game show on television. Over his years as a businessman, Trump gained notoriety for his racist and sexist views, which he made obvious during his campaign (Baker). Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Like Obama, Trump didn\u2019t win because of his experience in government. Donald Trump was elected purely for himself: his message, his persona and what he symbolized. In his announcement speech, Trump drew attention to illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism (Trump). After defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. \n\n\nOnce his position as the 45th President of the United States was secured, on November 21st, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy that negotiates \u201cfair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\u201d (\u201cTrump Says US to Quit TPP on First Day in Office.\u201d). As part of this plan, Trump confirmed that the United States intents to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership on his first day in office. Two months later, on January 23rd, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though Trump\u2019s actions were criticized by other politicians like John McCain, Senator Bernie Sanders applauded Trump for pulling out of the partnership. Sanders believes that the Unites States participates in too many free trade agreements, \u201cthat cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019, which has lowered wages for American workers.\u201d (Smith). As recently as January 9th, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced an agenda for the year that is set to replace Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule (Reuters Staff). Additionally, according to the fiscal 2019 proposal released on February 12th, 2018, the United States government plans to reduce the EPA\u2019s budget by $2.5 billion, almost twenty-three percent (Dennis). On March 8, 2018, Donald Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of twenty-five percent on steel and ten percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries (\u201cTrump Tariffs: US President Imposes Levy on Steel and Aluminium.\u201d). Lastly, on September 5th, 2017, Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u2019 program was being repealed. Sessions claimed that the DACA eligible individuals were lawbreakers who adversely impacted the wages and employment of native-born Americans (Smith). Sessions also attributed DACA as a leading cause behind the surge in unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America. Regardless of whether the Trump administration\u2019s decisions were correct, it\u2019s legislative actions are negations of Obama\u2019s implementation of the law. \n\n\nThe implementation of Barack Obama\u2019s policies served as a thesis for this dialectical conflict. Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies will serve as an antithesis for this dialectic. Just like Socrates\u2019 refutation and Caesar\u2019s murder, Donald Trump\u2019s complete removal and replacement of Barack Obama\u2019s policies would be impossible if Barack Obama had initially failed to even implement the policies. Currently, the reality one is concerned with is still implicit because it has not been fully exteriorized yet. For reality to be exteriorized, the thesis needs to be fully negated by the antithesis. For example, currently, the Trump administration is having legal issues with the rescission of DACA as it is being challenged in court by fifteen different states. Once the Trump administration is able to completely repeal the actions of the Obama administration, the antithesis will have formed, and reality will become explicit and able to be actualized. If President Trump is able to fully repeal Obama\u2019s policies, the general public should be able to realize that electing a president from the far Right directly after a president from the far Left will make no progress. The general public should understand, in order to make progress, they must elect a president that is able to serve as the synthesis for the dialectic. The general public must elect a president that is moderate, not democratic or republican. The reality one is concerned with here is of a presidency that is a synthesis of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\n\nIf Donald Trump is successful in completely removing Barack Obama\u2019s policies, according to Hegel\u2019s dialectical method, what should result with the next presidency is a synthesis that removes the flaws from Obama\u2019s policies while preserving the superior ideas. The process of \u2018aufhebeng\u2019 would sublate Obama\u2019s superior ideas with the policies of Trump in order to form what should be a more sophisticated president. If Trump\u2019s modifications to the Environmental Protection Agency results in an overall worsening of the United States\u2019 environmental quality, then the original restrictions placed by Obama would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. Contrarily, if Trump\u2019s repealing of DACA resulted in a lowering of unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America, then Trump\u2019s repeal of DACA would be captured in the synthesis of the next president. This careful analysis would be done for each legislative action taken by either president. Additionally, according to Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution of higher thinking, the next president would serve as the thesis for another dialectical conflict. Through Hegel\u2019s spiral evolution, one is able to eliminate less critical thinking, but must depend on an antithesis to exteriorize reality and actualize higher thinking. One is unable to conclude whether the action taken by the thesis is best serving the country until an antithesis is able to negate that action and exteriorize the implicit reality. The next presidency will be a synthesis of the past two only if President Trump is able to fully negate President Obama\u2019s policies. \n\n\n\n\n \nWorks Cited\n\nBaker, Peter. \u201cA President Who Fans, Rather Than Douses, the Nation's Racial Fires.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 12 Jan. 2018, www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/us/politics/trump-racism.html.\n\nBishop, Paul A. \u201cRome: Transition from Republic to Empire.\u201d www.hccfl.edu/media/160883/ee1rome.pdf.\n\nDavenport, Coral. \u201cObama's Strategy on Climate Change, Part of Global Deal, Is Revealed.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 31 Mar. 2015, www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/obama-to-offer-major-blueprint-on-climate-change.html.\n\nDavis, Julie Hirschfeld, et al. \u201cObama on Climate Change: The Trends Are 'Terrifying'.\u201d The New York Times, The New York Times, 8 Sept. 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/obama-climate-change.html.\n\nDennis, Brady. \u201cTrump Budget Seeks 23 Percent Cut at EPA, Eliminating Dozens of Programs.\u201d The Washington Post, WP Company, 12 Feb. 2018, www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/12/trump-budget-seeks-23-percent-cut-at-epa-would-eliminate-dozens-of-programs/.\n\n\u201cDonald J.

Hear it from him:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://jichikawa.net/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Ichikawa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I defended my PhD dissertation (&amp;quot;Imagination and Epistemology&amp;quot;) in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I&amp;#39;m married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/\"&gt;little while back&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Research Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My 2013 book, &lt;a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rules of Thought&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that &lt;em&gt;no square is a triangle&lt;/em&gt;. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what &lt;em&gt;makes it rational to believe&lt;/em&gt; that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what &lt;em&gt;makes that content the content that it&lt;/em&gt; is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I published my second book, &lt;a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contextualising Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the &lt;em&gt;Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Research Focus&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don&amp;#39;t\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;. (Rhetoric about &amp;quot;not jumping to conclusions&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;innocent until proven guilty&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;he said\u2013she said&amp;quot; tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I&amp;#39;m currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slightly more generally, I&amp;#39;m thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to believe unless certain conditions are met. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t believe if you have insufficient evidence!&amp;quot;) I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!&amp;quot;) There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it&amp;#39;s one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It&amp;#39;s hard to justify activism if you don&amp;#39;t take yourself to know what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional &amp;quot;philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions&amp;quot;\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I prepared a new version of &lt;a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;forall x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a treatment of soundness and completeness. I&amp;#39;ll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources.

          "selftext": "The moderators of /r/philosophy are pleased to announce an upcoming AMA by [**Jonathan Ichikawa**](http://jichikawa.net/), Associate Professor of Philosophy, University of British Columbia. \n\nThis AMA is the fifth in our [Spring 2018 AMA Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/7ram5t/spring_2018_rphilosophy_ama_series/); you can find more details on all of this semester's AMAs with philosophers by going to the [AMA Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/7ram5t/spring_2018_rphilosophy_ama_series/). You can find all of our previous AMAs over the years by going to the [AMA wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rphilama).\n\nProfessor Ichikawa will be joining us on Monday March 26th at 12PM EDT to discuss a variety of issues in epistemology. Hear it from him:\n\n#[**Jonathan Ichikawa**](http://jichikawa.net/)\n\nI was born and educated in various of the United States (California\u2013Michigan\u2013Texas\u2013Rhode Island\u2013New Jersey). I grew up in a conservative Christian family; I think a lot of my early philosophical thoughts came out of thinking through the implications of our church\u2019s theological commitments. I remember being deeply concerned about divine omniscience and free will, for example. I think I frustrated a lot of my Sunday School teachers. I\u2019m no longer religious, although I enjoy teaching Philosophy of Religion at UBC.\n\nI defended my PhD dissertation (\"Imagination and Epistemology\") in 2008 at Rutgers University with Ernest Sosa. I worked a few years as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, focusing particularly on thought experiments, intuitions, and philosophical methodology, before moving to UBC in 2011. I'm married to Carrie Jenkins, who is also a philosophy professor at UBC. (She did an AMA here a [little while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5hyf8l/i_am_carrie_jenkins_writer_and_philosopher_based/).)\n\n**Past Research Highlights**:\n\nMy 2013 book, [*The Rules of Thought*](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199661800.do)\u2014not to be confused with the YA novel that came out a few months later!\u2014was co-authored with Benjamin Jarvis. (Ben was in my PhD cohort at Brown; he was also the Best Man at my wedding.) The main project of that book was epistemology of the a priori, and a theory of mental content that makes sense of it. Consider the a priori proposition that *no square is a triangle*. This is something that it is always rational to believe. One of the central ideas of our book is that, contrary to the assumption of much of the literature, the question of what *makes it rational to believe* that content isn\u2019t the right question. Instead, we hypothesise that part of what *makes that content the content that it* is is that it is always rational to believe it. By defining content in terms of the rational roles that it has, we offer an approach to the nature of thought that makes sense of the epistemology of the a priori. The central question then becomes, how is it that human thinkers manage to stand in cognitive relationships with contents, so defined? This is one of our main focuses of the book. We also give some attention to philosophical methodology, and the role of intuitions and thought experiments in philosophy.\n\nLast year I published my second book, [*Contextualising Knowledge*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/contextualising-knowledge-9780199682706?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;). Here I defend a contextualist semantics for \u2018knows\u2019 ascriptions\u2014contextualists like me think that the English verb \u2018knows\u2019 has something importantly in common with indexicals (\u2018you\u2019, her\u2019), gradable adjectives (\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018funny\u2019), and quantifiers and modals (\u2018all\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019, \u2018must\u2019): the truth conditions of sentences using these terms varies according to the conversational context in which they\u2019re produced. My book connects this thought with the question of the theoretical significance of knowledge in epistemology. I argue that they\u2019re a better fit than people sometimes suppose. So I defend a contextualist version of knowledge norms of action, assertion, and belief, as well as some connections between knowledge and evidence and knowledge and counterfactual conditionals. Last year I also edited the *Routledge Handbook of Epistemic Contextualism*.\n\n**Current Research Focus**:\n\nContextualism is often motivated by reflection on radical skeptical scenarios. In some contexts one may say \u201cI know I have hands,\u201d while in other contexts one may say \u201cthere\u2019s no way to know whether I\u2019m a brain in a vat\u201d. This is not my primary interest in contextualism. I think the kinds of skeptical impulses that are sometimes expressed via very radical scenarios also have a lot of work to do in much more everyday contexts\u2014including ones that are morally, socially, and politically charged. Consider for instance skeptics about climate change. At their most sophisticated, they do not affirmatively deny that climate change is happening; they simply point out respects in which they think the evidence is insufficient and inconclusive, in order to argue against reform.\n\nSomething similar, I think, happens with sexual harassment and sexual assault reports. In a great many contexts, if someone tells us something they experienced firsthand, we just take people at their word. But sometimes we don't\u2014sometimes our tendency is to require further *proof*. (Rhetoric about \"not jumping to conclusions\", \"innocent until proven guilty\", and \"he said\u2013she said\" tends to encourage this way of thinking.) My current research focuses on this phenomenon: when is it more important to be slower to form beliefs, and when is the skeptical instinct the product of harmful assumptions? I think this kind of phenomenon is one contributor to rape culture. I'm currently working on starting up a research project on rape culture and epistemology.\n\nSlightly more generally, I'm thinking a lot these days about the difference between positive and negative epistemic norms. A negative epistemic norm is a norm that says *not* to believe unless certain conditions are met. (\"Don't believe if you have insufficient evidence!\") I think epistemologists tend to give short shrift to positive epistemic norms, according to which agnosticism and skepticism can be rational mistakes. (\"Don't suspend judgment if the evidence is conclusive!\") There is a strong temptation to associate skepticism with rationality, but it's one I think we need to be careful about, for both epistemic and political reasons. The epistemic and political are closely connected, given the connections between epistemology and action. It's hard to justify activism if you don't take yourself to know what's going on.\n\n**Teaching**:\n\nIn addition to my research, I of course spend a lot of my time teaching. I regularly teach epistemology, philosophy of religion, and formal logic at UBC. As you might guess from what I said above, my epistemology course tends to be more practically-oriented than some. In my philosophy of religion course I try to mix up the more traditional \"philosophy of claims that are of interest to religions\"\u2014e.g. arguments for and against the existence of God\u2014with some philosophical investigation into religion itself\u2014questions about the role of religion in society, questions about the nature of religious belief, etc. I also like philosophy of religion for its many access points into other traditional areas of philosophy.\n\nLast year I prepared a new version of [*forall x*](https://philpapers.org/rec/MAGFXU), an open-access formal logic textbook originally developed by P.D. Magnus. The biggest changes in my edition are the use of trees alongside natural deduction systems and a treatment of soundness and completeness. I'll be working on expanding and revising this text over the next year, with the support of a UBC Library grant supporting open-access resources. Given the financial constraints many students face, I think it's morally important for professors to avoid expensive required textbooks.\n\n**Other Bits**:\n\nBeyond philosophy, I'm an enthusiastic amateur opera singer, photographer, and long-distance runner. I have a [cat and a dog who are the best](http://instagram.com/mezzo.and.drusilla). I've been 'out' in a polyamorous marriage since 2011.\n\nI've been pretty involved in some of the public discourse about the norms of academia and professional philosophy. I played a role a few years back in some faculty expressions of concern about UBC's treatment of sexual assault allegations, and of UBC governance concerns generally. I've also been outspoken about things like journal editorial policies and the *Philosophical Gourmet Report*, as well as some famous examples of sexual harassment complaints in philosophy. I think it's fair to say I'm a slightly polarising figure within academic philosophy. Usually the trolls only treat me moderately terribly. Some get it far worse than I do.\n\n**Links of Interest**:\n\n* Paper (co-authored): [Rape Culture and Epistemology](https://philpapers.org/rec/CRERCA-2)\n* Book introduction: [What is Epistemic Contextualism?](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHIIE)\n* Book chapter: [Intuition in Contemporary Philosophy](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHIIC)\n* Book chapter (co-authored): [On Putting Knowledge \u2018First\u2019](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHOPK)\n* SEP article (co-authored): [The Analysis of Knowledge](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/)\n* Paper: [Dreaming and Imagination](https://philpapers.org/rec/ICHDAI)\n* Magazine piece (co-authored): [On Being the Only Ones](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgaw1sxphy1zev4/On%20Being%20The%20Only%20Ones.pdf)\n* Blog post: [Facts, Alternative Facts, and Definitions](http://blog.jichikawa.net/2017/01/facts-alternative-facts-and-definitions.html)\n\n\n**AMA**\n\nPlease feel free to post questions for Professor Ichikawa here.

Kierkegaard notes the conceptuo-linguistic connection between &lt;em&gt;deliberating&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;weighing&lt;/em&gt;\u2014which holds not only in Kierkegaard\u2019s Danish (&lt;em&gt;overveie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;veie&lt;/em&gt;) but also the Latin roots of our own usage (&lt;em&gt;deliberatus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;libro&lt;/em&gt;) (p. 306)\u2014and then proceeds to make a distinction that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy such a connection in Latin or English. A human being, he says, \u201cdoes more than weigh in the same sense as the scale does. He over-weighs [&lt;em&gt;over-veie&lt;/em&gt;]; he is higher than the weighing; he stands above the weighing\u2014he chooses\u201d (p. 307).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using a philosophical anthropology that will be familiar to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Concept of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Sickness Unto Death&lt;/em&gt;, Kierkegaard continues: \u201cIn weighing there must be two magnitudes; therefore the person deliberating, simply in order to be able to weigh, must be so composed that he has two magnitudes. This is also the case; &lt;em&gt;he is composed of temporality and eternity&lt;/em&gt;\u201d (my emphasis). Yet when we are young, we have little experience or \u201cprecise knowledge of temporality,\u201d and only a metaphorical grasp of the distinction between temporality and eternity. But even if we possess the notion \u201cthat eternity has the overweight,\u201d our earliest eternally-minded choices are \u201cof little use\u201d if they are \u201cnot repeated again and again\u201d (ibid.). We grow up and \u201cmust in earnest weigh and deliberate again,\u201d this time with a better understanding of the heaviness of temporality, asking, \u201cdoes eternity indeed have the overweight now?\u201d (p. 308).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, one may \u201cearnestly \u2026 ask the advice of someone who has been tried and tested,\u201d and \u201cGod be praised, such counselors, such witnesses, are still to be found, if not among the living, then among the dead and departed, and then first and foremost in Holy Scripture.\u201d So Kierkegaard turns (once again) to the apostle Paul, quoting 2 Cor 4:17\u2014the source of the theme of this discourse. But before he launches into his discussion of this theme, he remarks that \u201cif there is to be any meaning to this discourse,\u201d one must first \u201cweigh it\u201d and \u201csee to it that the counterweight of eternity is earnestly taken into consideration\u201d (ibid.). While this may seem \u201cself-evident,\u201d nevertheless \u201chow rarely, perhaps, a person weighs correctly in this way\u201d (pp. 308-9).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there may be relative value to deliberations of finite concern once we have discerned our ultimate trajectory, Kierkegaard does not mince words: \u201cTo deliberate on something temporal versus something else temporal when the eternal is left out is not deliberating. This is being fooled; this is wasting one\u2019s time and forfeiting eternal happiness by being fooled with life\u2019s childish tricks and games.\u201d Kierkegaard\u2019s target, remember, is not the explicitly non-religious who identify themselves as opponents of the religious life-view. It is, rather, those complacent bourgeois professing believers whose belief-profession extends only to their speech-acts and not the rest of their lives and behavior. He targets \u201cthe busyness and pompous importance\u201d of their deliberations, calling such trivialities \u201cbaseless and meaningless\u201d (p. 309). Though he does not use the word, this is not far from Nietzsche\u2019s surprising criticism of Christianity as a form of &lt;em&gt;nihilism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So \u201cperhaps many people live this way; they even call themselves Christians, although what is decisively the basis of all Christianity is just this basic meaning of deliberating,\u201d i.e., not about temporality vs. temporality, but temporality vs. the eternal (pp. 309-10). Kierkegaard compares such people to a wealthy carriage-rider who, because of his abundance of lanterns, \u201ccannot see the stars at all,\u201d while \u201cthe poor peasant, who drives without lanterns, can see gloriously in the dark but starlit night.\u201d The busy, worldly deliberators \u201chave everything around them and close to them so safe, so bright, so comfortable, but the extensive view is lacking\u2026 the view of the stars\u201d (p. 310).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those who are not only self-deceived but wish to promulgate their self-deception, those who wish to flatten the eternal difference between temporality and eternity, are not, on Kierkegaard\u2019s accounting, hypocritical Pharisees. But what, he asks, \u201cis actually worse: &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; a Pharisee who scrupulously indicates the right road but certainly does not walk it himself, a Pharisee whose words I can trustingly accept and act upon [cf. Mt 23:3], while I leave it to God to do what can never be my business\u2014to judge the hypocrite; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a so-called honest guide who does indeed walk the same road he recommends to others but, please note, changes the road and personally walks along the recommended\u2014road of error?\u201d (p. 311). (So perhaps Nietzsche is subject to Kierkegaard\u2019s critique after all, albeit as only an indirect target.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suffering one, consequently, must avoid this error. But when he does not, when he lets his existential heaviness\u2014in the temporal sense\u2014become \u201cdreadfully heavy,\u201d then \u201cwhen eternity eventually weighs him, it will surely find him to be too light\u201d (ibid.). Accordingly, Kierkegaard returns our gaze to the apostle\u2019s words, in whom is to be found no \u201cfalse weight.\u201d Again we read 2 Cor 4:17, on the basis of which the discourse maintains that hardship &lt;em&gt;procures&lt;/em&gt; for us an immeasurable \u201cweight of glory\u201d\u2014an \u201ceternal happiness\u201d\u2014and therefore \u201c&lt;em&gt;certainly does have an overweight&lt;/em&gt;\u201d (pp. 311-12). It has this superior weight vis-\u00e0-vis hardship not \u201cby chance\u201d but \u201cquite simply and directly, \u2026 even when the suffering weighs more\u201d (p. 312). But it can have this overweight for a person only through faith, for even when the sufferer lacks understanding and suffering is a \u201cdark riddle\u201d that cannot be grasped, faith is something she either \u201crebelliously casts away\u201d or something whereby she \u201cfirmly holds on to\u201d the overweight and its existential significance (p. 313). In the latter case, faith that even suffering \u201cwhich seems to be utterly evil and useless\u201d has eternal weight \u201cgives the perseverance of eternity\u201d (p. 314).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this perseverance, the sufferer\u2019s hardship seems \u201cbrief and light\u201d (pp. 314-15). Kierkegaard uses a couple of earthly analogies: \u201cDoes not the presence of a king make one speak differently from the way one usually does about the same thing! In the king\u2019s presence one says of some adversity that would ordinarily annoy and make one grumble at home: Your Majesty, it is a trifling matter.\u201d So too in the presence of one\u2019s beloved, one says, \u201cDarling, it is a small matter\u201d (pp. 315-16). And yet for the sufferer with the overweight of eternity, such forms of politeness go, as it were, to the opposite extreme, so that it seems almost rude \u201cnot to pay attention to it,\u201d to the suffering, at all (p. 316).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here Kierkegaard wonders whether just as a Christian\u2014on Martin Luther\u2019s accounting\u2014must \u201cwear the royal dress of the cross,\u201d he should not also \u201cbe practiced in speaking \u2026 the heavenly court language with all his heart.\u201d For \u201cgabbily to gush about the glory of eternal happiness is empty and foolish talk,\u201d whereas \u201cthe language of the royal court\u201d speaks \u201cwith closed lips\u201d yet \u201cwith the whole heart.\u201d Such talk \u201ccontains no falsehood in the sense in which we ordinarily and legitimately speak of the flattering falsity of royal court language,\u201d but is \u201cliterally true\u201d in this case, for to join the apostle Paul in calling even the heaviest earthly hardship \u201cbrief and light\u201d is quite true when compared with the infinite weight of eternity (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The \u201conly requirement for comprehending that [eternity] has the overweight \u2026 is fidelity to this conception of the happiness of eternity.\u201d Yet this requirement is not itself without a gravity of its own. For double-mindedness\u2014which, again, Kierkegaard dealt with at length in Part One\u2014is happy to speak at one time of the honor of serving eternity, but at a less convenient moment prefers to dissociate himself from it. He \u201cwill serve a cause only insofar as the cause serves him,\u201d will love \u201conly insofar as it is advantageous to him,\u201d etc. By contrast, remarks Kierkegaard: \u201cHow nobly faithful is the courtier who follows an overthrown emperor into exile and, when his imperial majesty is dressed in rags, still addresses him with the same submissiveness and homage as he did once in the halls of the palace and says: Your Majesty\u2014because he did not cringingly recognize the emperor by the purple and therefore can now nobly recognize him in rags\u201d (p. 317). (In this he anticipates one of the dominant themes, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; dominant theme, of his later book, &lt;em&gt;Practice in Christianity&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kierkegaard stresses that it is not just that the eternal weight of glory outweighs all temporal suffering in a &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; sense. Using another analogy to illustrate, he points to the adage \u201cthat a pound of gold and a pound of feathers weigh the same.\u201d Though \u201cthis is surely true,\u201d even so \u201cwe add that in another and more important sense the two magnitudes cannot be weighed together\u201d because \u201cthe gold has a special value that makes it meaningless to weigh gold and feathers together.\u201d Indeed: \u201cthe distinction is not between happiness and suffering, but between &lt;em&gt;eternal&lt;/em&gt; happiness and &lt;em&gt;temporal&lt;/em&gt; suffering\u201d (p. 318). And these are \u201cnot only heterogeneous in the essential sense as gold and feathers are but are heterogeneous in the infinitely essential sense\u201d (p. 319).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat an indescribable joy, great beyond all measure!\u201d Kierkegaard exults. \u201cWould that the sufferer might weigh properly\u2014indeed, better yet, would weigh so that he not only does not collapse under the weight of the suffering but instead sinks under the overweight of the eternal happiness so that in his presentiment of this eternal happiness he, so to speak, smashes the balance and says: Here there is not even a question of weighing!\u201d (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat, then, makes this generation so fainthearted,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwhat else but that it does not know the highest danger! \u2026 what else but that it does not esteem the happiness of eternity!\u201d Yet \u201cit is not at all the intention of this discourse to pass judgment; it wishes only that people would [themselves] judge in a different way. This discourse wants only to proclaim the gospel of sufferings\u2014something the speaker truly has not invented himself, something by whose proclamation he truly does not expect to gain merits\u2014it is too full of joy for that. Someone may gain merit by proclaiming this or that temporal truth, but eternity\u2019s truth and the joy of salvation are too joyful to have any room for the wretched bookkeeping of meritoriousness\u201d (p. 320).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even if \u201cin sheer self-sacrifice and in the heaviest sufferings a person were to continue uninterruptedly to proclaim this joy, he would still have no merit, because the joy of it is that when temporal suffering weighs down most heavily, eternal happiness still has the overweight. A temporal truth has to put up with having a current account with its proclaimers; but the happiness of eternity possesses a general receipt that makes current accounts unthinkable, because even when the suffering is heaviest, eternal happiness still outweighs it\u201d (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cThe Gospel of Sufferings,\u201d Discourse VII: \u201cThe Joy of It That Bold Confidence Is Able in Suffering to Take Power from the World and Has the Power to Change Scorn into Honor, Downfall into Victory.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
          "selftext": "The penultimate discourse of [Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/5yrr9v/kierkegaards_upbuilding_discourses_in_various/) of Kierkegaard\u2019s *Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits* is on \u201cThe Joy of It That the Happiness of Eternity Still Outweighs Even the Heaviest Temporal Suffering.\u201d (For previous posts, [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialChristian/comments/3pblkf/posts_on_kierkegaard/) under \u2018Reading Kierkegaard\u2019s *Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits*\u2019.)\n\nThe discourse begins with reflection on the deliberative presuppositions of beginning any course of action.

This is being fooled; this is wasting one\u2019s time and forfeiting eternal happiness by being fooled with life\u2019s childish tricks and games.\u201d Kierkegaard\u2019s target, remember, is not the explicitly non-religious who identify themselves as opponents of the religious life-view. It is, rather, those complacent bourgeois professing believers whose belief-profession extends only to their speech-acts and not the rest of their lives and behavior. He targets \u201cthe busyness and pompous importance\u201d of their deliberations, calling such trivialities \u201cbaseless and meaningless\u201d (p. 309). Though he does not use the word, this is not far from Nietzsche\u2019s surprising criticism of Christianity as a form of *nihilism*.\n\nSo \u201cperhaps many people live this way; they even call themselves Christians, although what is decisively the basis of all Christianity is just this basic meaning of deliberating,\u201d i.e., not about temporality vs. temporality, but temporality vs. the eternal (pp. 309-10). Kierkegaard compares such people to a wealthy carriage-rider who, because of his abundance of lanterns, \u201ccannot see the stars at all,\u201d while \u201cthe poor peasant, who drives without lanterns, can see gloriously in the dark but starlit night.\u201d The busy, worldly deliberators \u201chave everything around them and close to them so safe, so bright, so comfortable, but the extensive view is lacking\u2026 the view of the stars\u201d (p. 310).\n\nMeanwhile, those who are not only self-deceived but wish to promulgate their self-deception, those who wish to flatten the eternal difference between temporality and eternity, are not, on Kierkegaard\u2019s accounting, hypocritical Pharisees. But what, he asks, \u201cis actually worse: *either* a Pharisee who scrupulously indicates the right road but certainly does not walk it himself, a Pharisee whose words I can trustingly accept and act upon [cf. Mt 23:3], while I leave it to God to do what can never be my business\u2014to judge the hypocrite; *or* a so-called honest guide who does indeed walk the same road he recommends to others but, please note, changes the road and personally walks along the recommended\u2014road of error?\u201d (p. 311). (So perhaps Nietzsche is subject to Kierkegaard\u2019s critique after all, albeit as only an indirect target.)\n\nThe suffering one, consequently, must avoid this error. But when he does not, when he lets his existential heaviness\u2014in the temporal sense\u2014become \u201cdreadfully heavy,\u201d then \u201cwhen eternity eventually weighs him, it will surely find him to be too light\u201d (ibid.). Accordingly, Kierkegaard returns our gaze to the apostle\u2019s words, in whom is to be found no \u201cfalse weight.\u201d Again we read 2 Cor 4:17, on the basis of which the discourse maintains that hardship *procures* for us an immeasurable \u201cweight of glory\u201d\u2014an \u201ceternal happiness\u201d\u2014and therefore \u201c*certainly does have an overweight*\u201d (pp. 311-12). It has this superior weight vis-\u00e0-vis hardship not \u201cby chance\u201d but \u201cquite simply and directly, \u2026 even when the suffering weighs more\u201d (p. 312). But it can have this overweight for a person only through faith, for even when the sufferer lacks understanding and suffering is a \u201cdark riddle\u201d that cannot be grasped, faith is something she either \u201crebelliously casts away\u201d or something whereby she \u201cfirmly holds on to\u201d the overweight and its existential significance (p. 313). In the latter case, faith that even suffering \u201cwhich seems to be utterly evil and useless\u201d has eternal weight \u201cgives the perseverance of eternity\u201d (p. 314).\n\nWith this perseverance, the sufferer\u2019s hardship seems \u201cbrief and light\u201d (pp. 314-15). Kierkegaard uses a couple of earthly analogies: \u201cDoes not the presence of a king make one speak differently from the way one usually does about the same thing! In the king\u2019s presence one says of some adversity that would ordinarily annoy and make one grumble at home: Your Majesty, it is a trifling matter.\u201d So too in the presence of one\u2019s beloved, one says, \u201cDarling, it is a small matter\u201d (pp. 315-16). And yet for the sufferer with the overweight of eternity, such forms of politeness go, as it were, to the opposite extreme, so that it seems almost rude \u201cnot to pay attention to it,\u201d to the suffering, at all (p. 316).\n\nHere Kierkegaard wonders whether just as a Christian\u2014on Martin Luther\u2019s accounting\u2014must \u201cwear the royal dress of the cross,\u201d he should not also \u201cbe practiced in speaking \u2026 the heavenly court language with all his heart.\u201d For \u201cgabbily to gush about the glory of eternal happiness is empty and foolish talk,\u201d whereas \u201cthe language of the royal court\u201d speaks \u201cwith closed lips\u201d yet \u201cwith the whole heart.\u201d Such talk \u201ccontains no falsehood in the sense in which we ordinarily and legitimately speak of the flattering falsity of royal court language,\u201d but is \u201cliterally true\u201d in this case, for to join the apostle Paul in calling even the heaviest earthly hardship \u201cbrief and light\u201d is quite true when compared with the infinite weight of eternity (ibid.).\n\nThe \u201conly requirement for comprehending that [eternity] has the overweight \u2026 is fidelity to this conception of the happiness of eternity.\u201d Yet this requirement is not itself without a gravity of its own. For double-mindedness\u2014which, again, Kierkegaard dealt with at length in Part One\u2014is happy to speak at one time of the honor of serving eternity, but at a less convenient moment prefers to dissociate himself from it. He \u201cwill serve a cause only insofar as the cause serves him,\u201d will love \u201conly insofar as it is advantageous to him,\u201d etc. By contrast, remarks Kierkegaard: \u201cHow nobly faithful is the courtier who follows an overthrown emperor into exile and, when his imperial majesty is dressed in rags, still addresses him with the same submissiveness and homage as he did once in the halls of the palace and says: Your Majesty\u2014because he did not cringingly recognize the emperor by the purple and therefore can now nobly recognize him in rags\u201d (p. 317). (In this he anticipates one of the dominant themes, if not *the* dominant theme, of his later book, *Practice in Christianity*.)\n\nKierkegaard stresses that it is not just that the eternal weight of glory outweighs all temporal suffering in a *quantitative* sense. Using another analogy to illustrate, he points to the adage \u201cthat a pound of gold and a pound of feathers weigh the same.\u201d Though \u201cthis is surely true,\u201d even so \u201cwe add that in another and more important sense the two magnitudes cannot be weighed together\u201d because \u201cthe gold has a special value that makes it meaningless to weigh gold and feathers together.\u201d Indeed: \u201cthe distinction is not between happiness and suffering, but between *eternal* happiness and *temporal* suffering\u201d (p. 318). And these are \u201cnot only heterogeneous in the essential sense as gold and feathers are but are heterogeneous in the infinitely essential sense\u201d (p. 319).\n\n\u201cWhat an indescribable joy, great beyond all measure!\u201d Kierkegaard exults. \u201cWould that the sufferer might weigh properly\u2014indeed, better yet, would weigh so that he not only does not collapse under the weight of the suffering but instead sinks under the overweight of the eternal happiness so that in his presentiment of this eternal happiness he, so to speak, smashes the balance and says: Here there is not even a question of weighing!\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\u201cWhat, then, makes this generation so fainthearted,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwhat else but that it does not know the highest danger! \u2026 what else but that it does not esteem the happiness of eternity!\u201d Yet \u201cit is not at all the intention of this discourse to pass judgment; it wishes only that people would [themselves] judge in a different way. This discourse wants only to proclaim the gospel of sufferings\u2014something the speaker truly has not invented himself, something by whose proclamation he truly does not expect to gain merits\u2014it is too full of joy for that. Someone may gain merit by proclaiming this or that temporal truth, but eternity\u2019s truth and the joy of salvation are too joyful to have any room for the wretched bookkeeping of meritoriousness\u201d (p. 320).\n\nIndeed, even if \u201cin sheer self-sacrifice and in the heaviest sufferings a person were to continue uninterruptedly to proclaim this joy, he would still have no merit, because the joy of it is that when temporal suffering weighs down most heavily, eternal happiness still has the overweight. A temporal truth has to put up with having a current account with its proclaimers; but the happiness of eternity possesses a general receipt that makes current accounts unthinkable, because even when the suffering is heaviest, eternal happiness still outweighs it\u201d (ibid.).\n\n***Next:*** \u201cThe Gospel of Sufferings,\u201d Discourse VII: \u201cThe Joy of It That Bold Confidence Is Able in Suffering to Take Power from the World and Has the Power to Change Scorn into Honor, Downfall into Victory.\u201d",

Apologies if this is an askphilosophy thread; I couldn&amp;#39;t isolate a specific question so I decided to present all of it here. (In the spirit of transparency, this interpretation is heavily indebted to Deleuze--that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why I&amp;#39;m looking for another pair of eyes on this). Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hume was the first philosopher to realize that most of our knowledge (namely, our knowledge of facts) is synthetic. The term is Kant\u2019s, but Hume discovered its content and sense. What does it mean, for knowledge to be synthetic, knowing as a synthesis? Synthesis means going beyond what is given to us by our senses and memory. This is how Hume characterizes knowledge: I do not know when I say, \u2018I have seen a thousand sunrises\u2019 (because these are impressions preserved by the faculty of memory)\u2014but I do know when I say, \u2018The sun will rise tomorrow.\u2019 This is because there is nothing given to me which tells me what will happen tomorrow; I therefore go beyond the given (senses and memory) when I make such a statement. This is the case with all inductive reasoning, the object of which is knowledge of facts about the world: when I say that water always boils at 100C (a fundamental law of chemistry), I go beyond the given, because neither my memory nor me senses can give me \u2018always.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hume, within this epistemological framework, formulates a question in an extraordinary manner. He does not dispute the truth of knowledge, the truth of the statement, \u2018The sun will rise tomorrow.\u2019 In his eyes, this creates an unhealthy skepticism leading only to confusion and malaise. Nor does he ask, \u2018How do we know?,\u2019 because for Hume reasoning is simply an operation of the human mind, a part of human nature. Hume\u2019s question is: What are the grounds for this going beyond? According to what right to we use inductive reasoning? Why do we believe in the knowledge which inductive reasoning gives us? This is the problem of induction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hume offers two stages to this question. The first is a critique of previous dogmas on this point, typical assumptions made about inductive knowledge. The next is a constructive solution to this question of grounds. Critically: Hume argues that we cannot rationally justify our belief in inductive knowledge. Reasoning is either demonstrative or inductive. Now, the contrary of the statement, \u2018The sun will rise tomorrow,\u2019 can be conceived\u2014the results of deduction are certain and their contradictions inconceivable\u2014therefore we cannot justify ourselves in believing such a statement via demonstrative reasoning. And to use inductive reasoning is a circular argument (\u2018We can believe in what induction gives us because of induction\u2019) and merely begs the question at hand. Thus, with both forms of reasoning exhausted, Hume concludes that our belief in inductive knowledge isn\u2019t rationally justifiable\u2014reason is not the basis on which we go beyond the given.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is extremely disappointing to many philosophers: it seems to eliminate certainty from science. But the fact remains, that even knowing this criticism, we still believe in and avail ourselves of inductive knowledge, both in science and in daily life. (This problem appeared in the 18th-century, but that has hardly halted the progress of science or life since.) Whence this belief, if not from reason? Well, we believe that \u2018the sun will rise tomorrow\u2019 because we have seen it rise one thousand times. Hume presents us with new grounds in a secondary, constructive phase: this ground is habit, the result of experience. Habit, the principle of human nature. In other words, we believe in inductive knowledge because of psychological principles of association (the repetition of similar cases leads the mind to naturally associate a cause with an effect\u2014and experience gives us this multiplicity of similar cases). Therefore, we go beyond the given on the basis of habit; belief in inductive knowledge is justified not by reason, but by human nature. I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow because my mind naturally associates (the effect) tomorrow with (the cause) sunrise; I believe that bringing water to 100C will cause it to boil because I have seen this occur many times, and these many experiences have built up a natural association of 100C and boiling water which comes into play whenever I see one or the other (so that it is enough for me to see boiling water to know that it is heated at least to 100C). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kant, coming from a rationalist (and religious) background, is deeply disturbed by Hume\u2019s conclusions. He removed certainty from science, demonstrating that scientific knowledge (induction) is based on the foundation of human nature, not reason (insofar as human nature is understood as habit, not itself encompassing reason). The need thus emerges for empiricism, which could no longer find reason beneath induction, to be reconciled with science. Kant orients his first critique around this need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small text is motivated by a very simple question: how to judge if one is moral (a term we&amp;#39;re not going to try to define explicitly)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The term judge in the question means that a comparison is taking place. We compare an abstract moral system with the effective actions or behaviours of an individual. A moral system is defined as a not necessarily consistent collection of rules (categorical imperatives or simple heuristics) to follow in our daily life. The rules can be of two different kind: action-oriented (&amp;quot;it is forbidden to eat pork&amp;quot;) or consequence-oriented (A = &amp;quot;your actions should not make your family suffer&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;\nObviously, it is very easy to produce a moral system mixing action and consequence-oriented rules that is inconsistent (say, a moral system with &amp;quot;not killing&amp;quot; and A, with a situation where your mother is very ill, and would appreciate that you kill her to stop her suffering). This wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem if the system contained enough rules to treat these cases by telling us which (or how a) rule takes precedence over the others in particular situations. In practice, it seems impossible to have such a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; inconsistent moral system, unless it grants us a total freedom of decision in situations for which it shouldn&amp;#39;t, thus failing to be of any use. We therefore require a moral system to be consistent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above consistency requirement is stronger than it looks. It supposes that there exist some axioms (or principles) characterizing the moral system and constraining the behaviors of individuals thanks to modus ponens. Of course, if the moral system is supposed to be a complete guideline, then its number of axioms is certainly not finite unless it is trivial, which already makes it impractical. \nNow, by consistency of such axiomatics, if a behaviour can be proven true (hence moral) in an abstract situation, then it has to stay true in a concrete one where more details have been added. This is yet very easy to contradict. One can always add details to an abstract situation for which the behaviour characterized by the axiomatics shouldn&amp;#39;t be the moral one anymore, hence invalidating the axiomatics. \nFor example, in the trolley problem, if no detail is specified about the individuals, a discriminating criterion can be the number of people to save or to sacrifice. \nWhat now, if the lone individual is Einstein and the five are rapists? This instability of what we consider to be moral to adding more details means that our axiomatics is either inconsistent, or is too weak to prove anything about this general situation. It is actually believable that any kinds of non-trivial axiomatics is completely incomplete: it cannot prove something that cannot be dismissed in any concrete situations and is thus of no use to judge our own morality. Of course, this only dismisses the relevance of strongly consistent axiomatics to judge morality, but not their potential insights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if a mixed moral system contains an action-oriented categorical imperative (that is, a rule to be followed rigidly), the complicated and diverse nature of life is such that there certainly exists a situation in which the latter imperative contradicts at least one of the consequence-oriented rule. Note that it is also pretty hard to fulfill a consequence-oriented imperative: nobody has full control of the consequences of his actions, especially when they involve other individuals with very diverse cultures, expectations, or personalities. We consequently eliminate the possibility that a (useful) consistent mixed moral system exists and suppose that categorical imperatives are action-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if our moral system contains only categorical imperatives? The very nature of language and the way it interacts with the physical world (and thus, with real life) makes it very impractical: there is no canonical model of language into the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;. For example, in order to identify a real life object as a pen, a (subjective) judgement is necessary: one has to compare the whole idea of a pen with the properties, shape, color, or even the (usual or not, contextual or not) functions of the real life object one would like to name accordingly. \nEven though these judgements are subjective, they are not arbitrary and are naturally ordered by their propensity to explain the world and the situations we experience. That is, naming a real life object as a pen might indeed have a better explanatory power than naming it as a ball. \nOf course, in some particular situations, the relevance of these judgements can be tested algorithmically (say, by testing for some measurable properties of the physical object). This fails generally, especially for abstract concepts involved in moral systems or situations where a moral decision is expected. Moreover, the previous &amp;quot;explanatory power&amp;quot; is not something that can be measured at all, and it requires another judgement to conclude that our choice of label, while relevant locally, is also relevant to describe the world globally (and is thus able to increase our understanding of it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This lack of canonicity of models of language is of course quite general, but because categorical imperatives are both categorical and imperative, they are supposed to challenge our very nature and to be followed strictly. They offer much more than a simple guideline and leave no room for intepretation. Yet, is there a way to convince ourselves that our real-life models of them are relevant? Can we trust our judgements?  Worse than that, what about the very different (abstract) interpretations of the categorical rules themselves? A simple concept such as the one of murder is not free from ambiguity. How can we judge our own morality if we fail already to properly understand the moral system?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Categorical imperatives are on the one hand too rigid to capture the intentions they try to enforce, and on the other hand too ambiguous to convince us that our actions are not breaking them, especially when they are god given. Is it the intention that matters the most or the strict interpretation (which is itself prone to interpretation in any case) of the imperative? Who are we to interpret god&amp;#39;s intention? \nFor example, if one has to stay virgin before marriage, is it the intention of not having any sexual encounters that matters, or the scientific definition of virginity that allows blowjobs and others anal fuckeries?  This freedom of interpretation leaves way too much room for discussion and self-indulgence, destroying the original purpose of such moral frameworks. Moreover, if a True Interpretation of these rulesets exists, then either it is known only by god, or it is a dynamical one changing with the mood of the truth owner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about moral systems only containing heuristics? By definition, an heuristic is a pragmatic principle that can be accommodated to the complexity of life. This ability to be changed at will makes consistency of heuristic moral systems hard to achieve. A form of weak consistency, as in, the existence of a specific interpretation of the terms that are not blatantly contradicting each others, can also be problematic. For a given situation, how to decide which interpretation of the heuristics prevails? For example, a consequence-oriented heuristic such as &amp;quot;being freer is good&amp;quot; can mean anything and its contrary due to the multiple intepretations of freedom (individual, collective, restrictive, enlarging, ...). \nOne could expect the whole collection of heuristics to sufficiently refine and to constrain their interpretations. Even in this case, it is the individual and his intuition that eventually decide what to stick for. How can he convince himself that his current interpretation is moral and not an act of self-indulgence, conceding morality to his very nature? Moreover, his intuition can be wrong or decide differently from what is consciously judged as moral. Still, it is certainly a good idea to listen to intuition, and to exercise the right to veto it allows: intuition tells us when our heuristics are failing. At this point, dismissing rather than enforcing them stupidly is probably the best decision, especially since the weakly-consistent axiomatic system described is not yet complete, nor necessarily well understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to trust intuition to the extreme. Is there really a need for heuristic moral systems if the final word is necessarily given by intuition, and a veto right can be invoked at any moment? It is always possible to decree an equivalence between morality and what intuition says. Such a position is surely consistent, but trivial. In this case, there is no room for self-improvement, or any form of transcending (external, intemporal) judgement of morality. Moreover, individuals would agree that their natural decisions are often not moral (with their own definition of morality), sometimes leading them to regrets. Intuition is not even static: it can be influenced by knowledge, understanding, experience or even moods. \nIn this respect, a heuristic moral systems can help to refine our intuition and to stabilize our idea of moral. To do so, it is necessary to make the heuristics explicit, to make the latter consistent, and to deduce things. Yet, this process of explicitation and deduction takes time. It might not even be possible to complete it to a satisfying degree. In the meantime, are moral decisions taken blindly? Also, an argument that was invisible to an individual at a given time can drastically change his moral deductions once revealed. Is or when is this lack of knowledge and proper usage of modus ponens immoral? Are we moral to ignore something we should or could have known? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, it is intuition that has the final word. It is intuition that sticks to some heuristics, that interprets them, or that dismisses them for another collection. To judge if one is moral seems to require intuition to judge itself. Is it even possible in any convincing way? Some people lack intuition, while others lack self-consciousness or integrity. Are these people bound to be &amp;quot;bad people&amp;quot; because of their inability to judge their own morality properly, making (moral) self-improvement impossible? If so, to what extent is their lack of natural ability contributing to their lack of morality and responsibilities? On the contrary, being gifted would be of no use without knowing it, or if other mental qualities were lacking. In the end, it might be the case that there is just no convincing way to judge one&amp;#39;s moral: the world contains people who can do it, people who can&amp;#39;t, and there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do about it, not even knowing which one belongs to which group. Maybe god knows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
